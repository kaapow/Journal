				"content_html": "<p><em>I wrote this introduction while in Tampa this summer and its great to finally share it because it captures my thoughts on this world I’ve created.</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>Moon Racket!</em> is the story of two buddies living on the moon, making noise and eating cheese. It is also the story of my attempts at learning how to draw and write a comic series.</p>\n<p>Comics as a medium has been a passion of mine since my early teens. Sadly I never really got around to the actual act of writing and drawing comics, rather spent time circling around the activity itself. And so it was that all of my previous attempts never amounted to any <em>completed</em> comic work - save a four page story for a Guardian/Observer newspaper comic competition called <em>Coffee Beans</em>. To help me fight through this inherent procrastination, the barrier for <em>Moon Racket!</em> was purposely set very low. The result was that for nearly a decade this world and it’s characters would be my main creative outlet. But lets start at the beginning.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2010, I had a serious case of brain crack. Brain crack is a term coined by CGP Grey in an episode of the excellent podcast, <em>Hello Internet</em>, ‘…the longer we procrastinate on something we want to do, the more our brains build up expectations of how amazing it’s going to be. It’s like crack for your brain’. The project was based on an idea I had, after a hazy summer evening out in Athens when I was 21. I couldn’t let this idea go but I also couldn’t move it forward in a meaningful way either. Two events would enable me to break my brain free and allowed me to create my first real body of comic work.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 2000s, my creative adventures had been spent developing and honing my web and graphic design skills. I had started life on the internet to help me publish my comic work, the issue was that I fell in love with the web itself. The web combined a lot of what I loved about comics in the first place, but in a vastly different format. The web in the early 2000s was an exciting place. I swam in this space for years until the internet landscape changed (which I attribute to Twitter and Facebook) and it stopped being exciting. Another piece of technology would also come out around this time that offered another creative avenue to explore, the iPhone. With the introduction of the iPhone 4, what was possible on this mini computer in your pocket was starting to expand. I decided that I would try and use this this $880 (the going rate with taxes) device to create a comic, each panel would be the size of the phone screen. While the idea was well conceived, it was beyond <em>ambitious</em>.</p>\n<p>This entire series of characters was borne from a few images drawn on an iPhone 4 back in 2012. These were done using the crudest of styluses available at the time, which was a thin aluminium tube with a soft sponge attached to the end of it. The key elements of Corgan were there, the booties, long eyes and circles at all the joints. As I drew these characters, their world started to come into view for me. They lived on the moon. The moon was ostensibly made of cheese (and that would never run out of course). After realising that the little moon worm I had drawn was an organic being, he would need some form of air bubble around him to breathe (please don’t argue with my logic, it’s fragile). Very quickly however I hit technological limits. The combination of the crude stylus, the tiny screen and the poor feedback they both provided (when compared to my trusted Muji 0.38mm blank ink pen and Midori paper notebooks), would mean that I would stop this experiment early on. I count the experiment as a success, because it allowed me to create a new world to get lost in and finally shifted my attention to something different, setting my brain free.</p>\n<p>In the early 2010s, my life was transitioning from being a single man, to a fiancé, then husband and finally a father. I was living in the Middle East during this time, which was also going through its own transition as a region, as part of the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring started of as a series of anti-government protests and uprisings that started off in Tunisia and would quickly spread to Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain. Nearly a decade late, the chars of that movement are being felt in Syria which erupted into a civil war shortly after. I felt powerless to stop the strong humanitarian disaster that was unfolding around me, culminating in the image of Alan Kurdi washed up on the shore. An image which still haunts me to this day.

This car was entirely out of place in the tiny little town of Saida. It was not designed for roads designed within an old town with its own idiosyncrasies. It stood out, and was so awkward to manoeuvre anywhere. People would get out of their way offering guidance, like Navy Catapult Officers guiding a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier. For the entire summer, my dad relished in the fact that everywhere he went he was referred to as ‘Hakeem’ (hakeem being the Arabic word for doctor.) as he went about his business.

The final version might be a single book with illustrations but honestly that is years away.\n\n## Stet\n### 1. Built Environment Compendium Vol.2. \nThe purple volume. Finally got a print version of this. Will be editing this throughout 2023 and then hopefully Mike can review next year, for publishing summer of 2024.\n\n### 2. Automated Construction. \nThe yellow volume. Chapters 1-9 are written, need to stick the landing. This one is proving harder to write because it all has to come together as one volume. \n\n### 3. Built Environment Compendium Vol.3. \nThe orange volume. This is the last full volume that I wrote on Stet. Volume 4 is a way off considering all these other projects that I have going.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I don’t typically do this, but I thought it would be useful to consider the major items I bought this year. Since moving to Denmark I am increasingly more aware of the purchases we make, because frankly they are limited compared to our materialistic lifestyle in Dubai.</p>\n<h2 id=\"røde-microphone\">Røde microphone</h2>\n<p>This was the first piece of electronics I bought this year. Excellent build quality. Great size. I never used it beyond a couple of test files. This isn’t to say that I won’t, just that I didn’t incorporate this into my life in 2022. In 2022 I would like to release a single episode at least once a month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vaer-watch\">Vaer Watch</h2>\n<p>While not electronics, this was the first major purchase of the year. I have decided that I want to generally pace my watch buying to a single timepiece a year. This is a marathon not a sprint. The intention is to slowly build up my collection with purpose. While this watch does not have the heritage of many other watch brands, what I liked about it is that it fit into my yearly sub-theme, which is trying to get <em>sensible defaults</em> in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aoc-screen\">AOC screen</h2>\n<p>For the start of the pandemic I was using my little laptop screen as my primary device. There was a beauty to basically closing my laptop screen at the end of the week, leaving my desk clean for anything I wanted to do. When it became clear that we are in this for a while longer, I bought myself the largest screen that I thought would be compatible in our tiny little apartment. Its a 4K job. While nowhere near the density of my iPad Pro, it offers a huge step forward from everything work provides, while also setting me up nicely for one of my primarily purchases for next year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kindle-paperwhite\">Kindle Paperwhite</h2>\n<p>This was a replacement after 8 years with the previous model. A real upgrade. Glad that I waited as long as I did for this upgrade. At this rate I will get the next one at the end of 2029.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soundcore-q30-earphones\">Soundcore Q30 earphones</h2>\n<p>This is a <em>downgrade</em> from my Sony WX1000, except they are not really. They function excellently, they just don’t <em>feel</em> premium, because they are not. I bought these because I also got the next item as a replacement. These lasted me a hair under 4 years. The issue was a bit of plastic. Tried to fix it but alas it had to be replaced. At 1/3 the price of the WX1000s, my thinking is that as long as these current ones last over 1.5 years then I am winning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jabra-elite-75t\">Jabra Elite 75T</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaa.bz/2021/05/26/i-walk-out.html\">Last year I lost one earbud</a>. After many months of looking at the alternative, I decide to bite the bullet and re-order these. What I realised is that the case is super important.

				"content_text": "I don’t typically do this, but I thought it would be useful to consider the major items I bought this year. Since moving to Denmark I am increasingly more aware of the purchases we make, because frankly they are limited compared to our materialistic lifestyle in Dubai. \n\n## Røde microphone\nThis was the first piece of electronics I bought this year. Excellent build quality. Great size. I never used it beyond a couple of test files. This isn’t to say that I won’t, just that I didn’t incorporate this into my life in 2022. In 2022 I would like to release a single episode at least once a month. \n\n## Vaer Watch\nWhile not electronics, this was the first major purchase of the year. I have decided that I want to generally pace my watch buying to a single timepiece a year. This is a marathon not a sprint. The intention is to slowly build up my collection with purpose. While this watch does not have the heritage of many other watch brands, what I liked about it is that it fit into my yearly sub-theme, which is trying to get _sensible defaults_ in place. \n\n## AOC screen\nFor the start of the pandemic I was using my little laptop screen as my primary device. There was a beauty to basically closing my laptop screen at the end of the week, leaving my desk clean for anything I wanted to do. When it became clear that we are in this for a while longer, I bought myself the largest screen that I thought would be compatible in our tiny little apartment. Its a 4K job. While nowhere near the density of my iPad Pro, it offers a huge step forward from everything work provides, while also setting me up nicely for one of my primarily purchases for next year. \n\n## Kindle Paperwhite \nThis was a replacement after 8 years with the previous model. A real upgrade. Glad that I waited as long as I did for this upgrade. At this rate I will get the next one at the end of 2029.\n\n## Soundcore Q30 earphones \nThis is a _downgrade_ from my Sony WX1000, except they are not really. They function excellently, they just don’t _feel_ premium, because they are not. I bought these because I also got the next item as a replacement. These lasted me a hair under 4 years. The issue was a bit of plastic. Tried to fix it but alas it had to be replaced. At 1/3 the price of the WX1000s, my thinking is that as long as these current ones last over 1.5 years then I am winning. \n\n## Jabra Elite 75T \n[Last year I lost one earbud](https://www.kaa.bz/2021/05/26/i-walk-out.html). After many months of looking at the alternative, I decide to bite the bullet and re-order these. What I realised is that the case is super important. The overall design and how this thing fits into your ear is super important. The noise cancelling is super important. Jabra hits all of these at a reasonable price (when compared to the alternatives).\n\n## Ikea Modular Couch\nWe tried to keep using the makeshift Ikea day bed we brought with us from Dubai. It lasted a little under 2 years. It has been a wonderful addition to our living space and adding the lounge section was essential.\n\n## Babboe Cargo Curve\nWe went native with this one and got ourselves a cargo bike. When in Denmark and all that. This is probably Ryan’s favourite thing in the world. He loves vehicles and I can’t wait to use it in the spring and summer to take them all over the city.\n\n* * *\n\nLooking at the coming year, the three items I am looking at buying is a Mac Mini, the next watch (looking closely at the [Seiko SPB157](https://www.seikowatches.com/us-en/products/prospex/spb157)) and possibly an ivory Pro Gear.

I originally was trying to fit everything into a single book, a Hobonichi. Foolishness. No instead, what I actually needed was 5 distinct notebooks, plus a bunch of little pocket notebooks. Lets unpack that.\n\n## 1 / The Sketchbook\nI wish I had stumbled across this concept earlier in my life. Keep a sketchbook for exploration. Use one notebook and fill it with all the sketches, rough, finished, try different mediums, give yourself room to explore. What you might find in those pages is your style moving; shifting; growing. A visual playground of your own creation. What’s interesting about this is the first few pages are going to be poor even to your eyes. Don’t feel discouraged. Persevere and you will see yourself slowly but surely getting better.\n\nMy notebook of choice for this type of notebook is a blank A5 Midori MD.\n\n## 2 / The Journal\n\n> Your thoughts are like water.\n\nNow in my 5th year of regular journalling I don’t do this as often as I want (twice a day), but I have been carving some time out every day to go through it. This is your mental dumping ground. This is where you letter your mind write whatever it wants. The paper is not going to judge you. Better for you to write it down than let it float and bounce around your head.\n\nFor this, I have settled on the excellent sized [B6 Cafe Note](http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/cafe-note-b6-slim-grid.html) from Nanami paper. I’ve got a Gfeller cover that will last me years and years to come.\n\n## 3 / The Writer\nTurns out the best way to write articles, books or anything is to get it onto paper first. While my online writing can be captured pretty quickly in Drafts or iA Writer, when I want to work something out, the sequence of thoughts and ideas, there is nothing better than paper. For stringing these thoughts into cohesive sentences I go digital, but for working things out, I go analogue. \n\nAlthough I am currently using some Muji A5 notebooks, I have a massive [Seven Seas Nanami notebook](http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html) waiting to be used just for this purpose. Once my current notebook is finished (probably end of the year), can shift over to the book that will last me a whole lot longer.\n\n## 4 & 5 / Meeting Notes & Taskmanager\nFor years I employed the bullet journal method to get shit done at work. It was invaluable to me. However one of the issues is we live in an increasingly digital world and there are far to many channels. I found myself breaking the mould and away from some of the basic things that make the system useful (put the date at the top, collection of tasks for a topic, bullets for notes). It was all getting messy again. I also found the A5 notebook wasn’t getting filled out very well. \n\nSo I decided to split things a little. I have two A6 notebooks. One dedicated for just notes, ideas, whatever. The other is just to capture all of my actions into individual buckets. Every page is a channel. Whenever a task pops up I put it into one of the channels\n\nMy go to are the [Hobonichi A6](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2021/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_ob19_note/) notebooks. Blank and beautiful. No eccentric Japanese quotes or sketches of foxes or whatever else they have added recently to the Techo. I know this is probably part of the charm, but to be honest, I want that 20% lost paper per page to be mine.\n\n## 6 / Pocket Notebooks\nFinally I have been using pocket notebooks for over a decade. These go with me wherever I go. Its a practice that has served me well and even if it’s one note, its one note less bouncing in your head or worse, lost forever. I hate that.\n",

My sleep was terrible as I would wake up in the middle of the night and I could not get back to sleep.</li>\n<li>The same phone would be taken with me as we played with the kids and I would let my attention focus on this thing (even if it was for seconds or minutes).</li>\n<li>I would visit ‘news’ websites that were blasting bite sized pieces of information that added nothing to my life in the interest of ‘staying current’.</li>\n<li>I was texting people, thinking that this was enough for us as communication.

				"content_text": "It’s now been 4 weeks into my digital detox, so its time to review how that’s been going.\n\n## The Problem\nI have said this before and it absolutely remains the case but 4 weeks ago my attention was completely hijacked. I had fallen into a trap that I had enabled and partially built for myself.\n\n- I had 50 podcasts that I wouldn’t listen to. \n- I was subscribed to sites that would collectively pump hundreds of posts every day. \n- I was subscribed to email newsletters and services that would constantly spam me. \n- I was part of a few social networks that stole minutes from me throughout the day. \n- I found myself incapable of concentrating for a sustained period of time. \n- I would take my phone with me to bed (with the lie that it was acting as a clock, but it really wasn’t). My sleep was terrible as I would wake up in the middle of the night and I could not get back to sleep. \n- The same phone would be taken with me as we played with the kids and I would let my attention focus on this thing (even if it was for seconds or minutes).  \n- I would visit ‘news’ websites that were blasting bite sized pieces of information that added nothing to my life in the interest of ‘staying current’.\n- I was texting people, thinking that this was enough for us as communication. Sadly it was nowhere near where it should be.\n\nSadly this had been going on for years. What is _even_ sadder, is that looking around me, I know that I am not alone. If any of the above has resonated with you, then I honestly encourage you to try and read _Digital Minimalism_ by Cal Newport and start thinking about how you want to manage your life. \n\n## Life\nLike a switch that had been turned on, I was finally able to be more _present_ around people around me.

It’s something I have always struggled with. \n\nOne of the best chapters in _Digital Minimalism_ is about conversations (talking, phone calls and video calls) compared to connections (text messages & comments). It has really resonated with me. It is a little upsetting that I’ve effectively lost 10 years or conversations, but I think the friendship is strong enough to endure this short passage of time as we all got busy having families.\n",

In some ways, it has been both a revelation and joy to use. In other respects, it has been abject misery. \n\n## Protability\nWhere the iPad shines for me is it's portability. This thing is incredibly light. Solidly built and has an incredible battery that keeps on going and going. The fact that the pencil is magnetically attached to the top means it's always charged and ready to go. All in all, it is definitely the road warrior that I imagined it to be. \nI opted for the 12.9\" version, which is right for me, in most cases. It gets a bit big when I write notes, but this is mainly a mindset thing that I need to get past and work into my routine. \n\n## Keyboard Support\nWhile this isn't _perfect_, I use this with two keyboards. One by Apple and it's perfect and the other by Logitech and it works great at work as I need to flip between a Windows machine and my iPad.\nThe only issue I've ever really had is that sometimes support across various apps has been pretty buggy recently. Most notably with iAWriter, the keyboard goes haywire if I switch between apps. Its restored only when I restart the app.\n\n## Apps\nApps like [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/), [Procreate](https://procreate.art/), [iFontMaker](https://2ttf.com/), [Stop Motion Pro](https://www.cateater.com/), and [PDFExpert](https://pdfexpert.com/) truly shine on this machine in a way that other apps cannot. There are the apps that have been adapted exceptionally well. [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). [Soulver](https://soulver.app/ ). [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/). [Affinity's Photos and Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) work surprisingly well but they falter by the limitations of the iPad's poor support of a mouse which is where these types of apps shine.\n\nThen there are the apps that don't exist on the platform.

It's not been great. Everything from dictionary support to weird and wonderful bugs with the keyboard support. As this is my main machine for production, it's frustrating.\n\n## Fonts\nYes, you can have your own fonts installed, except for some reason, it's only through third party apps (none of which are very good). Why the hell isn't this baked into the OS?\n\n* * * \n\n## Fixing It\nI know it's fashionable to pile onto the iPad at the moment. The truth is that it wouldn't take very much for me not to pine over my macbook. \n\n1. Add the Safari Developer Tools. \n2. Give proper mouse support to the OS. \n3. Design a nice interface for font management. \n4. Sort out the bugs related to the keyboard support.\n\n## Moonshot\nThe thing that would be the real game changer for me is if the 3rd party developers are enticed to actually develop real productivity software for the platform.

If like me you are a burger connosieur, you understand that the bun **makes** the burger. You're very liable to forgive a lot more of what goes inside the burger, but if the bun isn't right, then the whole thing falls apart.\n\nThe receipe I would totally recommend is the [this one by Food Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN-AvNQcsRA). When I first heard Chef John, I thought this is a joke right? His tone grows on you and then the humour comes in, which is a nice touch. The only part I will be tweaking is the amount of yeast. I'll be using 1½ teaspoons rather than the recommended 2½ as it smelt too yeasty for our liking. The other part is that I think the buns could be a little larger, so maybe use halves rather than quarters.\n\nThe other video I would recommend is the one about making a [Shake Shack burger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04xuIuTcti0). It's a classic burger where less is more. \n",

However I keep reminding myself that this is not the UK, things are <em>decidedly</em> different here. The best example I can think of was when I was walking, I take a turn off the main high street, onto what looked like a simple residential area, and there at the end of the road I could see the wind turbines<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. It was just another reminder, things are different here. However, the biggest difference that I can gather is the city’s approach to transport.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transport\">Transport</h2>\n<p>The truth is though the city’s layout is different, the streets are wider. They have very distinct lanes for the different modes of transport. The lack of total dependence on the car is absolutely evident here. Every form of transport has been catered to in one form or another. Walking, cycling, scooters, boats, metro, train, buses and even the ‘humble’ car. The first few days I spent walking. That’s because this simple act of taking a long walk and watching what’s going on in the world has been an exercise that I have not been able to do over these last decade(?!). The Gulf is many things, but a haven and promoter for walkers it is not.</p>\n<p>Most telling for me is that I’m about to have walked more in the month of October, than any other month over the last year (according to my iPhone, which is missing a great deal of steps I know, but I’m using it as a loose indicator).</p>\n<p>I’m now also looking very closely at buying a Segway Ninebot Kickscooter as a fun and simple way to get around town. While there are scooters everywhere for hire, the cost adds up really quickly (by my calculation use the scooter for 140 trips and you’ve paid off the scooter). That’s the other thing about <a href=\"https://www.stet.build/is/013\">micromobility</a>, it’s generally really affordable, even if you have to replace the scooter relatively regularly - it’s a utility cost more than anything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"local-not-global-country\">Local Not Global Country</h2>\n<p>The other element that is clear here is the fact that this is not a Global city. There are no Amazon Prime trucks running around. There isn’t a MacDonalds or Starbucks on every corner (although these two staples do exist here). There is no Apple store. Vodaphone doesn’t operate here (at least I haven’t seen the Vodaphone logo anywhere). And so it goes. In this regard, it feels like a place caught in time&hellip;with it’s own home brands, made by and catering it’s own people. Some companies I’ve never heard of before, others have actually made the leap outside these borders.</p>\n<p>Over the last 8 years, the word ‘local’ was seen as a bit of a derogative term. Somehow, local here is celebrated, as it’s the main part of your every day life. It’s another part that I will need to recalibrate my thinking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"food\">Food</h2>\n<p>Since arriving in Copenhagen, I’ve eaten at one restaurant and it was a magnificent. The one thing that I do have to say is that the produce here is exceptional. I knew that strawberries here have a good reputation, but I didn’t expect that. Bringing the shopping into my apartment, I could smell them straight away. I haven’t smelt a strawberry in so long.</p>\n<p>Buying local chicken, local tomatoes, berries, have all really elevated my meals considerably. I’ve been getting more and more into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JamieOliver\">Jamie Oliver’s Food Tube</a> channel as well and have been really loving it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"language-barrier\">Language Barrier</h2>\n<p>I knew that this would be a thing. I’ve not gotten into a habit yet for listening and doing my Danish lessons but I do intend to do incorporate into my life very very soon.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>I know I’ve spoken about this before, but they always take my breathe away.

It was just another reminder, things are different here. However, the biggest difference that I can gather is the city’s approach to transport. \n\n## Transport\nThe truth is though the city’s layout is different, the streets are wider. They have very distinct lanes for the different modes of transport. The lack of total dependence on the car is absolutely evident here. Every form of transport has been catered to in one form or another. Walking, cycling, scooters, boats, metro, train, buses and even the ‘humble’ car. The first few days I spent walking. That’s because this simple act of taking a long walk and watching what’s going on in the world has been an exercise that I have not been able to do over these last decade(?!). The Gulf is many things, but a haven and promoter for walkers it is not.  \n\nMost telling for me is that I’m about to have walked more in the month of October, than any other month over the last year (according to my iPhone, which is missing a great deal of steps I know, but I’m using it as a loose indicator).\n\nI’m now also looking very closely at buying a Segway Ninebot Kickscooter as a fun and simple way to get around town. While there are scooters everywhere for hire, the cost adds up really quickly (by my calculation use the scooter for 140 trips and you’ve paid off the scooter). That’s the other thing about [micromobility](https://www.stet.build/is/013), it’s generally really affordable, even if you have to replace the scooter relatively regularly - it’s a utility cost more than anything.  \n\n## Local Not Global Country\nThe other element that is clear here is the fact that this is not a Global city. There are no Amazon Prime trucks running around. There isn’t a MacDonalds or Starbucks on every corner (although these two staples do exist here). There is no Apple store. Vodaphone doesn’t operate here (at least I haven’t seen the Vodaphone logo anywhere). And so it goes. In this regard, it feels like a place caught in time...with it’s own home brands, made by and catering it’s own people. Some companies I’ve never heard of before, others have actually made the leap outside these borders.\n\nOver the last 8 years, the word ‘local’ was seen as a bit of a derogative term. Somehow, local here is celebrated, as it’s the main part of your every day life. It’s another part that I will need to recalibrate my thinking.\n\n## Food\nSince arriving in Copenhagen, I’ve eaten at one restaurant and it was a magnificent. The one thing that I do have to say is that the produce here is exceptional. I knew that strawberries here have a good reputation, but I didn’t expect that. Bringing the shopping into my apartment, I could smell them straight away. I haven’t smelt a strawberry in so long. \n\nBuying local chicken, local tomatoes, berries, have all really elevated my meals considerably. I’ve been getting more and more into [Jamie Oliver’s Food Tube](https://www.youtube.com/user/JamieOliver) channel as well and have been really loving it. \n\n## Language Barrier\nI knew that this would be a thing. I’ve not gotten into a habit yet for listening and doing my Danish lessons but I do intend to do incorporate into my life very very soon. \n \n[^1]: I know I’ve spoken about this before, but they always take my breathe away. I love them so much because they signal progress. They signal the future married to the past that I was walking through. \n",

Although there arent' many templates to choose from, the basic ones included with the app do an amazing job of typesetting the work in a fashion that I can read/markup and edit freely.\n\nSure I would like a few features found in the [Highland](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/) app, such as sprint timer, native fountain support, and actual _comment_ support within the document, but this app provides me with so much and I highly recommend you consider it for your next project.\n",

The book was written back in 2009 (which I believe is now being followed up with a sequel of sorts) and was the right book to read, as the words have resonated with me, as a newly minted father of a second son.</p>\n<p>I started it around the time my Ryan was born and it&rsquo;s taken me 6 months to complete these 300 pages. I love to read, but <strong>clearly</strong> I don&rsquo;t carve enough time to carry the action out. My reading has been pretty scattered across multiple books that I never seem to finish. I&rsquo;m hoping this signals a return to a more regular reading pattern.</p>\n<p>What I also realised was that I&rsquo;m not happy with how I&rsquo;m reading. Or more accurately, the lack of taking notes or capturing the most interesting parts of books I read.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here are some key quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Art is a form of exploration, of sailing off into the unknown alone, heading for those unmarked places on the map.

				"content_text": "📚 I _finally_ finished a book this year, Michael Chabon's _Manhood for Amateurs_. The book was written back in 2009 (which I believe is now being followed up with a sequel of sorts) and was the right book to read, as the words have resonated with me, as a newly minted father of a second son. \n\nI started it around the time my Ryan was born and it's taken me 6 months to complete these 300 pages. I love to read, but **clearly** I don't carve enough time to carry the action out. My reading has been pretty scattered across multiple books that I never seem to finish. I'm hoping this signals a return to a more regular reading pattern.  \n\nWhat I also realised was that I'm not happy with how I'm reading. Or more accurately, the lack of taking notes or capturing the most interesting parts of books I read. \n\n---\n\nHere are some key quotes:\n\n> Art is a form of exploration, of sailing off into the unknown alone, heading for those unmarked places on the map. If children are not permitted - not taught - to be adventurers and explorers as children, what will become of the world of adventure, of stories, of literature itself?\n\n> Why else had they done it - built it all up so they could then knock it all down?

				"content_text": "<p>My earliest memory of my grandmother must have been when I was a little older than Zane (my eldest), I couldn’t have been more than 4 years old. It was just the two of us, my parents where elsewhere. She offered me a cheese ‘ashkawan’ sandwich, which I hesitated but accepted. What she produced was a mature cheddar cheese sandwich of such epic flavour, I can still taste it 34 years on. After demolishing the first one, she could see I wasn’t done and so she asked me if I wanted another. I remember how happy she looked at being able to offer such a simple thing that could elisit such a reaction — like she’d discovered my route to happiness and was going to use it. She was a master at giving genuine happiness from the simplest of things at her disposal. She would offer this happiness throughout her life and to everyone she came into contact with. And lemonade. Lots of lemonade.</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, my grandmother’s job was to spoil me (and to a lesser extent my brother). To that end she did an outstanding job. When she found out that I liked the peanut M&amp;Ms, she made sure she had a complete box for me. I ate so many peanut M&amp;Ms that summer, I still can’t bring myself to eat them any more.</p>\n\n<p>She would hand us an endless stream of toys with alarming regularity, and would take great pains to get something different and special. Sometimes I think she worked on these present ‘projects’ all year, in anticipation of when we came to visit.</p>\n\n<p>She was into <em>shisha</em> before it became fashionable — and did it the right way, in the comfort of her own home, after a meal to pass a few hours while looking out onto the sea and watching the world go by.</p>\n\n<p>Fiercely independent (she learnt the very hard way and very early on that she had to fend for herself) and with twice as much energy in her as other ladies her age (as experienced by the fact that she walked everywhere). Her favourite holiday destination was Syria (back before it was completely ravaged by war).</p>\n\n<p>Even though I’ve not had a two way conversation in over a decade with her, she was available to me during some tough times when I was in Lebanon. She helped me through them by being a willing ear.</p>\n\n<p>Without a doubt, one of the highlights of my wedding (there were many that day), was seeing my grandmother attend — she was bedridden for several years by that stage, so her attendance never even crossed my mind as a possibility. It took a lot for her to be there, and thankfully her nurse made it a reality.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/d9bea902d4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>My grandmother at my wedding</p>\n\n<p>A patient wife, a great neighbour, a dedicated aunt and a loyal sister — my grandmother was all these things and so much more.</p>\n\n<p>After 9 hard years (being bedridden and paralysed), she finally laid her head to rest and left this world behind her. I loved my grandmother. She died today.</p>\n\n<hr /><p><em>Nohad Abou Alfa, 1930–23rd December 2017</em></p>\n",

It’s a unique idea that asks for action, that calls to be implemented and put into action and to become part of your daily practice. The latest such idea is <strong>Stoicism</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Although my brother had mentioned it in passing a while back, the information washed over me like someone telling me all about Bitcoin. I paid it no heed and carried on about my daily business.</p>\n\n<p>In one of the latest episodes of the <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.email/podcast\">Kevin Rose Show podcast</a>, Kevin Rose interviewed <a href=\"https://ryanholiday.net\">Ryan Holiday</a> and what he said made a ton of sense to me, so I decided to take a deeper dive.</p>\n\n<p>I jumped straight to Marcus Aurelius’ <em>Meditations</em> and bought two versions. The first is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius-2003-05-06/dp/B01N4HXUYQ/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=meditations\">Gregory Hays translation</a> recommended by Holiday. The second is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-Handbook-New-Translation-Meditations/dp/0743233832/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=meditations\">The Emperor’s Handbook</a>) which my brother recommended.</p>\n\n<p>I have since followed it up with Ryan Holiday’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736?tag=dailystoic07-20\">Daily Stoic</a> as a good way to allow the ideas and ideology be digested in small bite sized nuggets. Of note is Holiday’s <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com\">website</a> dedicated to spreading the Stoic word — subscribing to his newsletter gives you a decent sampler to know if this is something you’d like to dig a little deeper into.</p>\n\n<p>The one exercise that I have taken to heart straight away is daily journaling twice a day. 10–15 minutes in the morning to capture what I want to achieve out of the day and 10–15 minutes in the evening to review and reflect on the day that passed and ask myself what I learnt and what I could do better.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The truth is that I can’t help myself and keep coming back to these characters. I’ve honestly tried to get into another project, but it’s clear that there is a whole world that needs to be explored, developed and discovered.</p>\n\n<p>This process is both therapy for me and I see it as a way to hone some of my skills to tell a story, develop a world before I take my mediocre skills into something more serious or demanding.</p>\n\n<p>What’s also clear to me, is that there is really no rush with these characters. This August marks 5 years since I first started working on Moon Racket! The below three images were created on an iPhone 4 as a way to use the Brushes app along with a <strong>really</strong> shitty stylus.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/d97975fb91.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/c70fd133dd.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/2ecc72e8cd.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Evolution of Corgan — Created on an iPhone 4</p>\n\n<p>Over time the characters have evolved significantly. The general ideas remain, however the details have changed and hopefully will continue to evolve.</p>\n\n<h2>Cast of Characters</h2>\n\n<p>This crept up on me to be honest. I started off with a grand total of 2 characters and little else. Over the course of the 5 years I’m now the proud owner of 10 characters and counting (I actually have a further 8 characters that I’ll be showing off sooner or later, but more on that in a bit).</p>\n\n<h2>Continuous Change</h2>\n\n<p>What I continue to be surprised by, is the fact that every time I create a new image, it adds something new and interesting to this world. I’ve only created two full images this year, but they basically added the orange colour which ties the art together, a new character (in Ison the rocket) and established a new vernacular for the type of buildings that I’d like to see throughout the Moon Racket! world (till now, I’d not shown the guys in the context of an actual physical place). Not bad for two images.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/e89a96e1c4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Black &amp; White artwork for header</p>\n\n<hr /><p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/252800b7e8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Completed colour artwork for header</p>\n\n<h2>Onomatopoeia</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve always felt that one of the main ‘characters’ in Moon Racket! should be the <em>onomatopoeia</em>. I’ve not really utilised this very much and kept the general use of the text and fonts to a minimum. That’s one aspect that I would like to explore a little further in future iterations of these characters.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the first time that I use a new font for signage. I’ve chosen ‘Phosphate’ as one option at the moment, although I also recognise that something more stylised might be necessary down the line.</p>\n\n<h2>The Future</h2>\n\n<p>Moving into the future, there is a children’s book that I am writing now — probably why I’ve not been drawing very much. It’s certainly taken a lot more out of me than I would have wanted. The concept is simple, but having read a considerable amount of children’s books over the last year, I would say that doing it in an exciting and fun way is a real challenge.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt at creating a new story, what I am looking into is to try and find a way to slowly create a story that is developed 1 panel at a time. The intention is to continue to draw on a regular basis and just build the story slowly and organically. I’m <em>reasonably</em> comfortable with the art side of things, that I’d like to flesh out these characters a little bit more and start to explore ideas and thoughts that I wonder about on a regular basis.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>At 7am, on Thursday, 27th of July 2017, one of my father’s uncles died. You see my father’s uncles really were more like surrogate fathers than <em>uncles</em>. To think of them as only <em>uncles</em> is to do a disservice to their relationship.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not that hard for me to express my affection for Hamzi. A softly spoken man, with the warmest smile and fiendishly clever wit. His house, always an exceptionally warm place for me.</p>\n\n<p>My fondest memories however of him are his interactions with my own father. My father could never say no to Hamzi. If ever he had a real weakness to his uncles, it was for Hamzi. Every uncle embodied a different lesson in life, from Hamzi he learnt kindness.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes Hamzi would frustrate my dad in a way that I could <strong>instantly</strong> relate to, as I would oftentimes experience that very same frustrations with my own father. Those frustrations melt away when you understand that you are completely powerless to do anything, just smiling and get on with, knowing that this person has stood by you in thousands of big and small ways throughout your life.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest part of today however was the thought of his daughter Farah rushing through the airports, through the traffic to try and get to her father’s funeral. I don’t know why this mental image just destroys me — maybe because it’s the image that made the whole situation real for me. The moment you realise that he’s physically gone.</p>\n\n<p>Of the many legacies that one can leave behind, memories of those you touched feed the fire and keep the person’s spirit alive in your mind — in that way he’s never gone. Another legacy would be in the children you helped raise. In that regard Hamzi and his wife Ouhayla, have left an incredible legacy in their children who have the same humility and kindness, as their parents before them.</p>\n\n<p>I checked the last time I wrote about death in my family was for my dad’s other uncle Ahmed, who passed away 9 years ago now. I wrote that eulogy when the wound was still raw. Ahmed wasn’t <em>the</em> last gentleman of Saida, he was but <em>one</em> of the last. Hamzi, like his brother before him, undoubtedly belongs within this elite group.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So I honestly didn’t think that the first series that I would be writing about is Brexit. I thought I’d be talking about something simple like waste in the house, energy efficiencies and creativity. No instead I get to delve into what happens after the referendum of 23rd of June, 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Before we get to that, a little personal history is in order. I feel that it’s important for me to write some of my thoughts on Brexit and the referendum, <em>mainly</em> for myself, so that I can review in a few years time what it is that I was actually thinking, and <em>partly</em> for my son when he asks me in the future why Britain is not part of the European Union.</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in Greece, which against all odds remains as part of the European Union. My formative years were lived in the UK (started my life in Nottingham before moving down like many to London). For the last 6 years I’ve lived outside the UK. That’s a long time and I’ve missed out on some truly amazing things. The referendum on the 23rd of June 2016 however has to be one of the most important things that I wasn’t really a part of. Something that will both affect my future and my son’s future.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for my leaving the UK are generally that even being an Engineer working for one of the most respected consultancy firms in the world, life in the UK is built around the concept of at least two income per households — everything else is a bit of a struggle for survival or an incredibly miserable grind.</p>\n\n<p>My single biggest issue with Brexit, apart from the fact that it’s an ill conceived reaction led by a bunch of buffoons with little to no understanding of the damage that it will do to millions of people, is the fact that overall it’s a clear sign of people and humanity moving in the <em>wrong</em> direction. Rather than being inclusive of each other, we are pushing each other away and building boundaries between us — whether artificial or real.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly the whole situation has broken my heart and my spirit a little bit. Growing up in Athens, but with no European Citizenship, I know what it feels like to be out of the union. In a few years time, I will have this feeling all over again.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>You have to start somewhere. Creativity is borne oftentimes of <strong>constraint</strong>. While this is something that has been talked about, finding your own constraints is actually much harder to do in practice.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve always wanted to maintain a voice on the internet. Back in 2004, blogging and the community that surrounded that activity on the internet was an extremely exciting and vibrant. I desperately wanted to be a part of what was happening. The problem was that after I exhausted the initial ideas (which to be fair took years to exhaust) I didn’t really find my voice. The options available to me were limitless…and that was the problem.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s in a name</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time I’ve used the term <em>Cerebral Interviews</em>. In my first website, from back in 2004, it was the very first category or tag that I used to describe the general noise that was flowing in my head.</p>\n\n<p>I then tried to use that same term for a newsletter that I ran for a year. The newsletter had a bunch of links and commentary that would be published once a month. It was mainly sent through to my friends and family and received approximately 0% engagement from anyone on the list. Hardly a roaring success but it allowed me to get somethings off my chest.</p>\n\n<p>What I’ve realised is that actually although I love design in general, it distracts me from the actual creative work. I will miss the fun that I’ve had learning HTML/CSS/PHP (I could never wrap my head around Javascript for some reason), but I need to add enough constraints that will allow me to produce more regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Design can now be constrained to the images and stuff that surround the work that I publish, rather than the vessel in which they’re delivered to. Medium has my back.</p>\n\n<h2>The Product</h2>\n\n<p>Which brings me to the actual content at hand. What’s the point of my existing online. Why not limit my output to links and commentary on my Twitter and Instagram accounts? There’s also all the work that goes into producing <a href=\"http://www.moonracket.com\">Moon Racket!</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Twitter doesn’t allow me to craft an article, or publish comics with the inherent presentation that is available at my fingertips on <em>Medium</em>. Having a platform ready to go will allow me to concentrate on the task at hand and actually just finish pages and publish them is an important one for me.</p>\n\n<p>By publishing here, the amount of fiddling available to me is constrained and that will hopefully help me to focus on the final products.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I’m not sure when it happened exactly, but somewhere along the way, I just gave up creating and giving a shit about <em>creating</em> for the internet. I gave up following comic books in a semi-religious manner. I gave up playing basketball every single week. I gave up watching movies regularly. I gave up writing to my various website.</p>\n\n<p>My aim has always been to create a <em>small</em> library of stories that I’ve written and drawn that are available in a multitude of formats (from digital to paperbacks and hardcovers). It’s a reasonably modest aim, but with the option of becoming greater depending on scale.</p>\n\n<p>Do I think that this library of stories will provide me with a living? Probably not, unless I have some serious success somewhere and hit on the zeitgeist in a way that I can neither predict nor anticipate. So I’ll be content to having a series of books with my name on the spine and that finally put to paper the ideas in my head.</p>\n\n<h2>Little strokes fell great oaks</h2>\n\n<p>I’m clear that for the time being I will not have hours and hours to my name. I can however carve 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening and effectively do 2 pomodoros. High burst sets of 30 minutes pieces of work. That’s 7 hours a week. That’s 364 hours a year. If I spend 10 hours per page that equates to 36.4 pages of story and art. If I manage to do a page of art a week, then I’ll be able to do around 50 pages a year. The size of a European album.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers don’t lie. It all starts with 2 pomodoros every single day. The issue however is life getting in the way. Sometimes you’re extremely tired. Sometimes the boy doesn’t sleep. Sometimes I have a business trip or I’m not feeling up for it. This is only natural. The difficulty is finding a way to get back into the routine. Routines are hard won and easily lost.</p>\n\n<h2>Deadlines</h2>\n\n<p>The last piece of the puzzle. I have about 8 projects that are not really linked with each other floating at different stages of development. I need to stop the <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/money/entrepreneurship/addicted-ideas-give-brain-crack-go/\">braincrack</a> from spreading and destroying my flow.</p>\n\n<p>So I’ll be dedicating 1 year to any of these projects. That gives them enough time to mature. Of course if I’m close to finishing any of the projects then I’ll continue till I finish, but if I’m completely off, then that one gets parked and I move onto the next one.</p>\n\n<p>So as a way to keep track, 2015 was mainly <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">Moon Racket!</a> and will extend to the end of 2016. After 2016, I will stop work on this series (unless it’s exploded) and then move onto the next project.</p>\n\n<p>This all begins tomorrow morning - I’ll be back regularly to discuss progress.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>5 months. That’s a really long time between updates. The truth is that I was creating things until at least the very end of september, it just so happened that I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about them.</p>\n\n<p>The main reason for the radio silence over the autumn and start of winter is down to the fact that I’m relocating to Dubai. That’s been a huge drain on all of my ‘free’ time and drawing and creating has been relegated to the <em>too difficult to deal with</em> drawer.</p>\n\n<p>I have decided to take this time to reflect on what I want to do with my creative output once things have settled down a little bit more.</p>\n\n<h2>Moon Racket!</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve got 10-15 new strips of <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">Moon Racket!</a> to publish and then I’d like to stick to the routine of publishing something new to <em>Moon Racket!</em> at least once a week for the entire year of 2016.  Obviously I’ll likely fail, but I want to at least <strong>try.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The main focus moving forward will be to improve the strip with actual backgrounds. I’m painfully aware at the general lack of backgrounds and environment that is missing (or at least that could be better defined than right now).</p>\n\n<p>However I won’t be publishing 4 panel strips. It’s not how my brain works. Rather I’ll be writing stories that will take up several panels, maybe entire pages with these characters in them. I have the first story roughed out, so just need to get cracking.</p>\n\n<h2>Chroma</h2>\n\n<p>The real push in 2016 will be for me to finally draw and start publishing <em>Chroma</em>. This is a very long time coming and I feel that if I don’t do it now, I’ll likely never do it. After multiple attempts at starting this project, I’m now of the mind that it’s better to get it out there, in whatever form it comes, rather than trying to get it perfect from day one. It will never be that so I should stop worrying about it.</p>\n\n<h2>Creative Output</h2>\n\n<p>If I’m able to publish 1 page a month of <em>Chroma</em>  and the weekly <em>Moon Racket!</em> page, then 2016 is likely going to be a MONSTER year . I’m fully aware that this is an ambitious programme for me (considering what goes into moving to a city like Dubai), but this is work that I’ll be carrying out first thing in the morning. The intention is to carry out 1-2 hours of creative output a day, <em>every</em> day, <em>every</em> morning.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>For years I&rsquo;ve been exceptionally content with my choice of pen, the Muji 0.38mm gel ink pen, in <strong>black</strong>. The main issue with the pen was the cheap plastic enclosure that held that wonderful refill. I grew exceptionally bored of it and I was willing to splurge some money on something that was better.</p>\n\n<p>Previously I&rsquo;d splash money on stationary related to my artwork, but never for my work related stationary. My hunt for a better enclosure made me look at all of my stationary in a decidedly different way and led me down a rabbit hole that I am yet to emerge from (listened to all the episodes of the <a href=\"http://www.relay.fm/penaddict\">Pen Addict podcast</a>). Thankfully the situation is a lot more under control than when I first started on this journey. After a year of buying a wide range of pens, I now know pretty much what will appeal to me and will fit into my rotation pretty much instantly.</p>\n\n<p>I intend to go into a decent amount of detail but rather than writing everything in one single shot, I&rsquo;ll highlight the main takes for now:</p>\n\n<ol><li>I&rsquo;m likely not going to be expanding my fountain pen collection past a <a href=\"http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US_INTL.FWI.displayShop.106959./classic-205-black-silver\">Pelikan M205</a> in the future. It stops here at my <a href=\"http://www.sailorpen.com/professional-gear.html\">Sailor Pro Gear Slim</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html\">Midori MDs</a> are the only choice of sketch notebooks that I will likely ever use. These are perfect. The A4 version is next on my list.</li>\n<li>Nothing beats my <a href=\"http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&amp;Sub=52\">Muji 0.38mm pen</a> for quick sketching and inking - the <em>Pilot Juice</em> pens come in a close second. I&rsquo;ve still to find my ideal holder - the original Takumi pen was a massive disappointment, hopefully version 2 goes in a better direction. Might have to design one myself.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using my <a href=\"http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/index.html\">Hobonichi Techo</a> (although not as often as I would want to and not with the type of content I was hoping for) - will be trying out an A5 version this year., maybe that format suits me better?</li>\n<li>I will be getting a Nanami <a href=\"http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html\">Seven Seas Standard</a> notebook in the future as well.</li>\n<li>The Penxo is one of the best conceived and delivered Kickstarters that I&rsquo;ve ever used - even though they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong leads.</li>\n<li>I will be getting a <a href=\"http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/\">Field Notes</a> subscription in November. I like the fun of seeing what these guys come up with and have been enjoying collecting these notebooks.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve still not found my ideal EDC pen. I still have time to back the <a href=\"https://www.massdrop.com/buy/karas-kustoms-edk\">EDK</a>, but not sure if that&rsquo;s the one for me.</li>\n</ol>\n",

One of the things I’m currently working on is the coloured version of the characters.\n\nOne of the comments that’s been made to me is that the black and white version of the strip is holding back potential readers. Some just are not all that into <strong>glorious</strong> black & white comic art - it feels, <em>unfinished</em>. This week’s strip will be an experiment to see whether or not that really is the case.\n",

He&rsquo;s chosen arguably the <em>worst</em> job in Greece at the moment but this latest 6 short bullet points is an interesting stake in the ground. His latest post <a href=\"http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/01/why-we-recommend-a-no-in-the-referendum-in-6-short-bullet-points/\">Why we recommend a NO in the referendum – in 6 short bullet points</a> is an interesting idea to summarise their government&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>While everyone is saying that a NO vote would effectively mean that Europe ejects Greece out of the Eurozone, Varoufakis is claiming that this would not happen. Why it will not happen is still not clear to me however. From an interview (with a less the eloquent minister in Syriza) on the BBC earlier today, it appears that they think that European law excludes such a thing from happening. Honestly when the money and stakes are this high, I doubt new rules cannot be rewritten.</p>\n\n<p>Sunday is only a few short days away and we&rsquo;ll see how the Greek people will vote.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started listening to the podcast <a href=\"http://hellointernet.fm\">Hello Internet </a> - if you&rsquo;ve not had a chance i recommend you listen and actually try and stick through it as its a pretty good conversation between two interesting hosts.</p>\n\n<p>Just finished episode 3 (although I&rsquo;ve also listened to a few of the later episodes, and then jumped back) but the concept of 4 dials or light bulbs in ones life was discussed. The concept stuck with me however what I realised is that actually my dials are different due to my physical location. So to recap the original four dials:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Family</li>\n<li>Work</li>\n<li>Health</li>\n<li>Friends</li>\n</ul><p>What I&rsquo;ve realised is that while the first 3 items remain relevant in my life, the last one however has dropped effectively to 0%. In its place my <em>comic book</em> work has taken its place.</p>\n\n<p>When we moved over to Doha the idea of starting fresh with no support network to start from was a daunting one. The truth is, we&rsquo;ve not actually really developed this support network in any way since we moved here 3 years ago. Apart from the guys in the office, I&rsquo;ve really not ventured very far in this realm. I try and maintain my connections with my friends, but seeing as they are far away, this was one aspect that I knew was going to take a hit. The concious decision was that we didn&rsquo;t expand that circle at all.</p>\n\n<h3>By the Numbers</h3>\n\n<p>This is effectively what my percentages look like at the moment:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Family: 30%</li>\n<li>Work: 50%</li>\n<li>Health: 5%</li>\n<li>Comics: 10%</li>\n<li>Downtime: 5%</li>\n</ul><p>Will I ever become a professional cartoonist? Not when I only am dedicating 10% of my energy to the task, it&rsquo;s really at best, a hobby, a simple side project. My job as an engineer isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon and my family time and health time are as low as I&rsquo;m going to go at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>The only part that I could take away is the downtime (watching movies, television, surfing the internet, reading a book or magazine). Those things however are important to keep you sane.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I have with this breakdown is that the reality of the situation is such that I am actually using that 10% and doing wonders with it. I&rsquo;ve been able to create multiple websites that I run quasi-regularly. I&rsquo;ve been able to create a web comic that I&rsquo;ve invested an incredible amount of time to write, draw and now publish. I do acknowledge however that this has been at the expense of other things, and that&rsquo;s fine for the moment, but it&rsquo;s not going to stay like that for very long.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I’ve decided to use <a href=\"http://www.medium.com/@moonracket\">Medium</a> as an additional platform from which I publish the new season of my comic, <em>Moon Racket!</em> Multiple factors coalesced to make this decision.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I have used 3 different platforms to publish and distribute my comic strip:</p>\n\n<ol><li>The official <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">website</a>, hosted on Tumblr</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/moonracket\">newsletter</a>, powered by Tinyletter</li>\n<li>Tapastic (at least in the first season).</li>\n</ol><p>Moving forward I’ll be publishing on Medium, <em>Moon Racket!</em> and through the newsletter. So what brought about this change? To answer that question, I think I should answer another question, how have the other platforms been faring?</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that each of the above platforms provided very specific (detrimental) restrictions on the artwork itself, but also allowed for a potentially wider distribution. The problem is that this wider distribution never manifested itself in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<h3>Tumblr</h3>\n\n<p>Moon Racket! is hosted on Tumblr, a platform usually suited for rectangular posts that fit within the stream that is present for eveyone. The restrictions on images are therefore made to suit their platform. The maximum size of image that can be posted is one that is 1200px wide. On a retina screen that’s the equivalent of a 600px image. The effect of this restriction is that my comic always appears blurry.</p>\n\n<p>While this is a nitpick, for a perfectionist like myself, it’s a deal breaker.</p>\n\n<h3>Newsletter</h3>\n\n<p>If I thought that Tumblr provided restrictions, then I was in for a rude awakening with my newsletter experience. This one can only be typically shown in a 600px wide image, otherwise it will break most inboxes.</p>\n\n<p>My experience with Tinyletter has been mixed. But ultimately my question for a beautiful experience was wrecked by that platform’s constraints. In mitigate I’ve moved things over to Mailchimp, which I’m hoping will offer better options and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Even then, I’m still not showcasing the art in the best possible way.</p>\n\n<h3>Tapastic</h3>\n\n<p>This platform holds promise, but once again there are size restrictions to the images that can be uploaded. While the platform as a whole does allow for a plethora of things aimed at comic content creators, I don’t believe that I would be able to reap many (any?) of those benefits.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also being lost in the sea that is being published there. Some of which is aimed at a very different audience.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>Which brings me to Medium.</p>\n\n<p>The editor provided on Medium is without question the best editor on the internet, have tried a very large number of them.</p>\n\n<p>The other instant win for Medium is how the platform chooses to deal with images. They’re not just first class citizens, they are allowed to exist in a manner that makes them shine. In fact the more I write about this, the more convinced I am of what an idiot I am for not considering this platform earlier.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest question I have is whether I can connect with an audience for an all ages comic strip about a robot (Corgan) and his worm friend (Alfie) that live on the moon, that’s made of cheese on Medium.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a journey I’m happy to take, because if nothing else I’ll take it in <strong>style</strong>.</p>\n",

There are however some constraints that I have been trying to work my way through. <em>High resolution</em> images on Tumblr are constrained in size to 1280px for normal high res photos and 2560x500px for panorama photos.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that Moon Racket strips don&rsquo;t really fall into either category. I could potentially use the panorama photos setting, but that would mean making things fit into a 500px height (which isn&rsquo;t great). Here&rsquo;s a look of what the panorma would look like using the <a href=\"http://moonracket.com/post/119418092109/in-plain-sight\">latest weekly</a> (which dropped yesterday):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/a59360f369.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama\" /></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively I could upload the image as 1280px. On a retina display that works out to be a 640px image (which honestly is tiny). My website allows for a 960px width - on a retina display that&rsquo;s 1920px. If I do let Tumblr do it&rsquo;s thing, then my crisp black lines that I&rsquo;ve worked long and hard on, become this blurred mess.</p>\n\n<p>The only other solution I&rsquo;ve found is to host the images on Flickr and then link them over. I get to post the image that I want in any resolution that I please. This solution does not make for very good Tumblr citizen but it makes for a better web site.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>The irony of course is that both Flickr and Tumblr are owned by Yahoo! - so the image is hosted on their servers anyway. The whole thing is just annoying and you end up loosing out on some of the cool features that are inherently a part of Tumblr - for the sake of a few measily pixels.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>You know what I miss? I miss <em>daily</em> blogging.</p>\n\n<p>5 years ago, the last time I was blogging on any regular basis, there was a rhythm to my publishing madness. Every morning would bring with it the promise of writing something new; sometimes it would be trivial, other times it would be &lsquo;important&rsquo;. The trick was to <em>show up every day</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The last year has honestly stripped me of very little personal time as I juggle being a husband, a father and an engineer. What little spare time I do have, I try and relax by drawing, inking, reading or watching a little bit of television as time permits.</p>\n\n<p>In that respect my online worlds are effectively extensions of a <em>life diary</em> that I’m creating piece by piece. I might own the content, but it’s hosted by someone else.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>When I sit and consider what I’ve created over the last several years, my online endeavours are not high on that priority list. I&rsquo;ve created countless websites, written at this stage thousands of posts (large and small) and while it did provide me with an outlet, none of it will last very long. Maybe none of it will matter except as a marker from a different time in my life.</p>\n\n<p>My online space has now become somewhat diluted across multiple platforms (an <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/khaledaboualfa\">Instagram</a>, several Tumblrs, a couple of Twitters, a <a href=\"http://www.dribbble.com/khaledaboualfa\">Dribbble</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/khaledaboualfa\">Flickr</a>, a <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/moonracket\">Tinyletter</a>). What happens is that I end up not generating as much content for each platform but what I&rsquo;ve realised is that this might not actually matter. What matters is work that I find <em>meaningful</em> that will last.</p>\n\n<p>Which then leads to be to start questioning my general output. What work can I look back on objectively and be proud of? Over the last 4 &frac12; years my output has been limited to all things <a href=\"http://www.moonracket.com\">Moon Racket</a>. This was a pretty concious decision on my part. Focus on a single project allows it to grow it&rsquo;s potential. This is the work that I have devoted my free time for, and this is the work that I hope will blossom over the coming year.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been drawing <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">Moon Racket</a> for several years now. You wouldn&rsquo;t know it, as I&rsquo;ve only released around 23 images in total. The truth is that I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of sketches, doodles and even strips that have not been released (apart from the odd snap on <a href=\"http://instagram.com/khaledaboualfa\">Instagram</a>). There are two resons for this:</p>\n\n<ol><li><strong>Quality</strong>. The creative process and the quality in the first few years really wasn&rsquo;t that great. When I look back at <em>Season One</em> I cringe (and that was the art I was &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with at the time). However if I didn&rsquo;t persevere, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position I am now, where I am comfortable enough to draw the characters in a few short minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule</strong>. This one is actually a self imposed reason. My thinking being that I cannot really predict how often I&rsquo;m likely to finish a drawing and do all the necessary post-production work. So instead the idea was to bank an entire season before I started publishing. The problem with this decision, is that nothing gets published (in my case over a year) and any momentum is lost.</li>\n</ol><p>That is actually an issue that I would <em>like</em> to address. The simplest solution is to publish things as they become available and ignore the whole issue of <em>schedule</em>. As a companion to this solution I&rsquo;ve also decided to create small single image strip (created in my favourite notebooks of all time, the Midori MD A5 notebooks) that takes a few hours to draw and ink to provide stop gaps between more involved strips.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the first image.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/8087c5d5f0.jpg\" alt=\"Season 2 Gang\" /></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>How often do you read a comment to a review on Amazon and can&rsquo;t stop laugh? This comment for the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG\">Zojirushi SM-SA48-BA Stainless Steel Mug</a> is one of those.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I bought the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA the week after I got married so that I could keep my coffee warm on the commute to and from my new job downtown. It is literally the world&rsquo;s best travel mug. I could put steaming hot coffee in it in the morning, and if I forgot it in my truck I would still have steaming hot coffee for the drive home. No kidding! It&rsquo;s incredible. This was an exciting time for me. My time with Jennifer was limited but boundless in its glory. When I wasn&rsquo;t working, Jennifer and I would go hiking at the park, take road trips, sit up late and watch the stars. And, of course, have long nights of passionate love making. And through it all, my 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA provided me with hot, fresh coffee and a sleek, ergonomic feel. It&rsquo;s amazingly well designed and made to last.That was seven years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then follows it up with this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These days, Jennifer is as cold and emotionally distant as an uncharted asteroid. Now the most passionate conversations we have involve either our fiberoptic internet bandwidth or Your Damn Mother. At work, I am merely a shadow defined by once-authentic ambition. Original thought at my office is as pointless as a Libertarian vote, and my commute is like a scene from Walking Dead. I&rsquo;m writing this on my iPhone as I sit behind a third-world chicken truck on I-35. I&rsquo;m numbing myself to waste another eight hours at The Bad Place and fantasizing about replacing the painful vacuum of affection from She Who Cannot Read Oil Change Reminder Stickers with that new girl from logistics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And ends strongly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But now that I think about it, the one constant source of warmth and comfort in my life is still the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA. Buy one. Buy one now, or feel only the chill yearning for an early grave that poor life decisions and emotional complacency can reap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also bonus, read the followup <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R37USG0ZWZUEQM/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00HYOGUM2&amp;nodeID=284507&amp;store=kitchen#wasThisHelpful\">comments</a> which give the actual truth, which is a lot more heartwarming.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It’s been a while since I checked in on progress for <a href=\"http://www.moonracket.com\">Moon Racket</a> Season 2. My <em>original</em> deadline for this season has shifted somewhat, but my plan was somewhat flawed in that I thought I could finish off the art the same year that  Zane (my son) was born - I am that <em>hopelessly</em> optimistic. That was never going to really happen. \nThe good news is that I made incredible progress while I was on holiday and thankfully I am still riding that momentum. When I left in  December I had 6 strips fully completed. Now a little over a month later I have over 20 strips that are in varying degrees of completness. In addition to that I was able to work through the thumbnails for the remaining 10 strips. That&rsquo;s right, unlike the first season (which was 20 strips in total),  Season 2 will be expanded to 30 strips.</p>\n\n<h3>Frictionless Creation</h3>\n\n<p>I attribute the fact that I&rsquo;ve been able to create <em>anything</em> at all to the fact that I&rsquo;ve made a concerted effort in trying to remove as much friction in the creation process as possible.</p>\n\n<ol><li>Make sure that each script has the thumbnails worked out for the entire page. Doodle, change the script if necessary.</li>\n<li>Do all the lettering. I use <a href=\"http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch\">Sketch</a> for this as it&rsquo;s my Freehand alternative. This gives me the word placement so that I can taylor the art accordingly (make sure the character&rsquo;s head isn&rsquo;t covered by a balloon).</li>\n<li>As I&rsquo;m drawing all the artwork on A3 board, I need to cut them down the middle. I then also drew all the panels in, so that I have one less excuse to actually getting started on the art (ie doing something without actually doing anything).</li>\n</ol><h3>Hopes &amp; Aspirations</h3>\n\n<p>One of my desires for this strip, is that as I continue to draw it in the future, I&rsquo;ll always be able to look back and see a progression from the previous year. It means that I&rsquo;m trying to make the strip better and make myself better at the creation process. What I didn&rsquo;t anticipate was seeing a fluidity in the characters between the very first strip I drew and the recent strips.</p>\n\n<p>This poses the question of whether I should go back and rework the original drawings to meet that fluidity or leave them as they currently are as a marker. My initial reaction is to leave them as they are. This is an ongoing strip, rather than a finite graphic novel. Things don&rsquo;t actually have to look consistent (nor do they, when you compare the very first season even).</p>\n\n<h3>Deadlines</h3>\n\n<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t really tempt fate and declare a deadline, but I want to be able to start publishing the newest season in the spring some time and feel that this goal is completely within my reach. The next massive hurdle that I have to start considering is how I promote the hell out of this series once I&rsquo;m finally ready to actually publish. More on that in future posts.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I&rsquo;m currently on holiday, which typically means that I have enough time to consider various aspects of my life. For this trip I decided to leave my computer at home.The reason for this were two-fold.</p>\n\n<p>The first reason was really about my general <em>transition</em> over the last several months away from the digital and more into the analogue. As a more pencil, paper and pen inclined man, I wanted to disconnect a little bit more.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason is the big one, <strong>distractions</strong>. With a fully capable computer, my possibilities for wondering into a different world, creating something else, or &lsquo;researching&rsquo; is near infinite. I know this of myself and I wanted to limit that access.</p>\n\n<p>Instead I took my new iPhone 6 and a bluetooth keyboard bought over 7 years ago now (Apple doesn&rsquo;t build shit). Ideas would begin life on paper first and then would move over to the digital world. The digital is the final destination (at least at the moment). It is the final product, how ideas and art is shared others - a delivery medium many take for granted because of it&rsquo;s ubiquitous nature.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this process has helped me focus greatly on <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">Moon Racket</a> (I&rsquo;ll have more to discuss about this on my <a href=\"http://brokenkode.com\">process site</a>) and allowed my mind to engage more with my family which has grown by 1 this year.</p>\n\n<p>One of my goals for the year is to try and write more (promise this will be the only time I write about writing more, I&rsquo;m as jaded about these types of posts like you are). I enjoy the process of writing something a little more longform. There are plenty of places for me to capture my banal and personal musing (that&rsquo;s either in my <a href=\"http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2015/planner/\">Hobonichi Techo</a> or within <a href=\"http://dayoneapp.com\">Day One</a>). This site will be a way for me to work some things out. Once a week. The length and format isn&rsquo;t as important as the mere act of writing and exercising this muscle that was used on a regular basis some 10 years ago and which has gone dormant over the last 5 years.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>When I moved to the Middle East at the start of 2010 I used to listen to podcasts usually in the comfort of my home and from my computer. This meant that I actually consumed the programmes sporadically <em>at best</em> and wasn’t a particular follower of any except the odd comic book related podcast.</p>\n\n<p>Sometime around 2011 all of that changed when I got my first (and so far only) iPhone. It’s getting <em>seriously</em> long in the tooth and will be getting an upgrade pretty soon but one of my primary uses on a daily basis is downloading and listening to podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Two things have come together that have really made the process seamless for me. Background downloads and bluetooth integration with my car.</p>\n\n<p>The last part which is possibly the most important part to come together is the general high quality, diversity and format that many of these podcasts have adopted.

				"content_text": "<p>Without a doubt my single most favourite piece of technology of the last 10 years has been my original iPhone 4. It&rsquo;s lived by my side, every day for 4 years straight and been with me as I&rsquo;ve transitions from bacholor, to husband, to father. I created <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">Corgan and Alfie</a> on there as well.  It&rsquo;s travelled with me to Lebanon, England, Malaysia, Qatar and Greece.</p>\n\n<p>However these last 6 months have been pretty rough. My home button stopped functioning very well (<em>sporadically at best</em>) and as was going to happen eventually, the apps became more optomised for newer hardware which effectively slowed them down on the older hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all that I still use the phone very single day for the following tasks:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Alarm Clock</li>\n<li>Podcasts (using <a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast</a>) every morning before heading off to work. My phone connects to my car via bluetooth <em>of course</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reederapp.com\">Reeder</a> for when I&rsquo;m waiting for something</li>\n<li>Whatstapp and Messages</li>\n<li>Receiving and making phonecalls (I know <strong>shocker</strong>), both the stock app and on Viber and Skype</li>\n<li>Safari</li>\n<li>Checking my emails (currently using mail.app)</li>\n<li>Checking photos of the boy</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://parents2parentsapps.com/soundsleeper/\">Sound Sleeper</a> to put the boy to bed</li>\n<li>And I&rsquo;ll even throw in a game or 3 (rediscovering the classic <a href=\"http://www.hexage.net/radiant/\">Radiant</a> recently)</li>\n</ul><p>Not bad for a 4 year old phone. However sometime after the <a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/28/apple-announces-special-event-for-sept-9/\">9th of September</a> that&rsquo;s going to change, following the release of the new iPhone. It honestly could not have come sooner.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, that while I&rsquo;m still using my phone consistently every day, I&rsquo;ve stopped enjoying using it and one fundamental aspect I have stopped using entirely, that of taking photos.  4 years on, it&rsquo;s really showing it&rsquo;s age in this respect. The camera interface takes a good long time to load and even when it does the pictures are just not that great when compared to my wife&rsquo;s iPhone 5c and certainly not my Sony NEX-F3.</p>\n\n<p>So while the phone has served me incredibly well and for a great long period of time (more than any phone I have ever owned), it&rsquo;s time to say it&rsquo;s swang song and be relegated for the newest and greatest from the minds of Jony Ive and the fine folks a Apple.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/07eef6376f.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

Sure Zane is little less than 3 months old and he&rsquo;s only recently started giving us his best smile, but it&rsquo;s enough to put all those sleepless, difficult nights, all the nappy changing and scream fests into the rose-tinted past - <em>it wasn&rsquo;t that bad right</em>? <strong>Right</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>No of course it wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>\n",

We finally took Zane out of the house and into the big bad world. We got all the gear, took the nursing cover with us in case he needed to eat while we were out and off we went to the mall (yeah it&rsquo;s August in Qatar, there&rsquo;s precious little else you can do at 2pm in the afternoon).</p>\n\n<p>Everything was fine, until we went into <em>Mamas &amp; Papas</em>. After being nursed in the changing rooms for 20min I was tasked with burping and holding him, and he went MENTAL. Usually pretty good at sorting the boy out, yesterday was not meant to be. After having walked back to the car TWICE,  I had to go back a third time to return something. Baby continued crying and I was just tired at this stage.</p>\n\n<p>Come home and my arm was seriously aching because I&rsquo;ve been holding him looking outwards and my arm is his seat. Mentally, I was tired of this for today. I needed a bit of break, thankfully sleep came easily to both of us.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>This morning I saw the trailer of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Cl_KOO-sE\">Theory of Everything</a> and it just completely smacked me in the face that I should be genuinely thankful for every single moment I have with the boy and never take it for granted. Ever.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I have many examples in my life where fathers cannot be there for their children in one capacity or reason or another - this trailer just gave another example, but reminded me clearly of this fact.</p>\n",

The first is actually the last panel found in Season One, while the second panel is the first panel for Season Two which I am currently in the process of drawing.</p>\n\n<p>To me the difference couldn&rsquo;t be more stark - it honestly feels like two different people drew these. The difference of course is confidence in the characters, but I&rsquo;ve also changed my tools and the way I&rsquo;m approaching the art in general.</p>\n\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n\n<p>While tools are not the reason for art to be rubbish, the wrong tools can&rsquo;t help the process either. The first thing that&rsquo;s changed is the paper. I&rsquo;ve gone from a reasonable rough yellowy paper in a perfect bound art book to individual cut &ldquo;bristol board&rdquo;-thick A3 sheets. The difference is liberating in that the final panel is hanging off a thick stack of paper underneath it (as it&rsquo;s not part of a book).</p>\n\n<p>The second thing that I&rsquo;ve done is move away from my trusted Copic markers and have moved on to the much cheaper and much better Uni Pin black pigment pens for the thicker pen sizes. I still use my trusted Muji Gel ink pens for all the inking of the standard lines.</p>\n\n<h3>Size Matters</h3>\n\n<p>The last part, that as far as I&rsquo;m concerned has transformed the artwork for me and allowed me to move up a level, is increasing the size of the individual panels. Suddenly I have soo much room to breathe and stretch my artistic muscle.</p>\n\n<h3>Time</h3>\n\n<p>Although Season One was never rushed, I didn&rsquo;t give the pencils enough time to mature. Like a fine wine, pencil work should sit there for a little while to develop in your eyes and allow you to see and correct all the little mistakes. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to redraw entire panels if they&rsquo;re not right. While moving to ink is exciting, leave it for a day, come back to it. Do some more penciling instead.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Although many will claim that there is still a great deal of work to be done to bring the level of typography in the graphic design and online world forward (and in many respects I agree), I honestly do believe that we live in the start of a golden era for type and the fonts that enable it.</p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend I bought the sublime new font <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/sanelma/\">Sanelma</a> from Finnish designer <a href=\"http://mahti.fi\">Mika Melvas</a>. The font itself inspired me to start actual work on a little project I&rsquo;ve had brewing for a while - which is all you can ask from a font before you&rsquo;ve begun using it really.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/172e66ebc9.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>This led me down a rabbit hole on all things typography. I realised that a lot of what I enjoy doing and creating relates back to typography in one way or another. My website work is mainly typography, my comic work hangs on the frames created by typography, my day job is revolved around drawings and design which also is very closely related to typography.</p>\n\n<p>Although I <em>was</em> extensively using <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro\">Source Sans Pro</a> on all of my three websites, I&rsquo;ve since transitioned things over to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipotype/libertad/\">Libertad</a>, as I felt it gave my sites enough of a unique feel to warrent this transition. The main problem has been in how these fonts are delivered to my Tumblr powered websites (as Myfonts doesn&rsquo;t provide a hosting service like <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> or <a href=\"http://typography.com/\">Typography</a> do).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/4b4f0070dc.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the one gripe I have with Myfonts. If you&rsquo;re going to make me pay you for a license to use an online font, then provide a service with the cost/overhead of that font. Typekit I believe has the right model, with the basic paid version coming in at a very reasonable $25/year. The main font that I would consider using is <a href=\"https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova\">Proxima Nova</a>. Without fail, every time I see a site using the font, I always instantly go, wait, what&rsquo;s that font? Of course it&rsquo;s <em>Proxima Nova</em>. Just because I don&rsquo;t use it right now, doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t in the future. It is ubiquitous for a reason, it&rsquo;s that good onscreen.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/9b8616ef9e.jpg\" alt=\"Proxima Nova Banner\" /></p>\n\n<p>The thing with Typekit however, is that you don&rsquo;t get any of the <a href=\"http://typography.com/\">Hoefler</a> (&amp; <a href=\"http://frerejones.com/\">Frere-Jones</a>) fonts, which I would love. Their fonts are much more expensive to license at $100/year. If I was making $100/year off my websites I would consider it, but alas that&rsquo;s an additional cost I&rsquo;m not that comfortable paying. However I would love to use <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/styles/\">Ideal Sans</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Take heart, there is now a growing collection of fonts that are amazing to use and either at great prices or for the great price of Free.

				"content_text": "<p>1 week ago today  that&rsquo;s Thursday 29th of May, I arrived home and Yasmine is faffing around telling me that we&rsquo;ve got to sort out <strong>my</strong> bag for the hospital and that she&rsquo;s got several errands that she wants to run over the weekend (cut her hair, pop into Mothercare for some last minute items). I nod my head, not registering everything after an excessively long week at work.</p>\n\n<p>A few hours later, while sitting (and trying to decompress) on the couch, watching something completely irrelevant, Yasmine calls me from the bathroom. I drag myself to the bathroom to see what she wants.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Honey, I think my water has broken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a moment of Hollywood weakness I tried to show that I wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We&rsquo;re about to have a baby!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I knew that labour was going to be tough but my god I was NOT expecting the drama that would unfold over the next 20 hours. Obviously I now have a much deeper appreciation pregnant women and what they have to go through. For the course of 9 months they endure <em>morning</em> sickness (stupid and incorrect name, it should be called <em>all day, at any time</em> sickness but maybe <em>morning</em> was more catchy?), pains, aches, heartburn, funny bowl movements, general discomfort when you&rsquo;re hauling around an extra 16kg of weight.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;d think that was enough right? Wrong. After they&rsquo;ve endured all of that, they&rsquo;re treated to MANY hours of torture. After that is done, then you get the discomforts associated with healing and a messy hormonal system. In my engineering mind I kept thinking, there must be a better more efficient way right (that didn&rsquo;t involve cutting a woman open for a c-section)?</p>\n\n<p>The 20 hours of labour tested my resolve completely. Seeing your wife in excruciating pain for HOURS is hard when all you can do is wait, pace, loose some sleep and worry. The last 30 minutes before Zane was born was easily one of the most difficult times in our lives together or apart.</p>\n\n<p><em>However&hellip;</em></p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe the elation one feels when you see your first born child. It&rsquo;s a feeling unlike one I&rsquo;ve ever and will probably ever feel again - for those that have experienced it you know what I&rsquo;m talking about, for those that are considering it I highly recommend it. I stayed at the top of the bed and when the doctor raised Zane he was blue and red and yet instantly my eyes just became completely overwhelmed with tears. Those tears didn&rsquo;t leave for several hours. In fact nearly a week later I still can feel the tears starting to come back to me as I write this.</p>\n\n<p>So I sit here 1 week to the day and I marvel at our son and the long journey to bring him here. How did 1 week go by already?</p>\n",

So I&rsquo;ve decided (belatedly I&rsquo;ll admit) to take some time and get my digital house in order.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to take a step back and reviewed what software solutions I have at my disposable and start putting the <em>correct</em> kind of information into each bucket.</p>\n\n<h3>Dropbox</h3>\n\n<p>Previously I had relied almost exclusively on <a href=\"http://dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a> to provide me with all of my synced document needs. Dropbox is amazing for so many things but it&rsquo;s become clear that the folder structure keeps things hidden - to the point that I don&rsquo;t even remember I had certain files and it&rsquo;s definitely not the most secure of places for the more sensetive documents.</p>\n\n<p><em>Active Projects</em> - I&rsquo;m using Dropbox as both a backup tool and a versioning tool as well (sure I should be using Github for that, but this works for me).</p>\n\n<p><em>Sharing Documents</em> - I share a great deal of files at work with different people in different companies. Dropbox has been a lifesaver for this sort of task.</p>\n\n<p><em>Backups</em> - Photos from my iPhone make their way into the photos folder in Dropbox. I&rsquo;ve created a backup folder that collects my social media output (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr) into one place. To do that I&rsquo;m using <a href=\"http://ifttt.com\">IFTTT</a>, which is a great little service for this sort of thing.</p>\n\n<h3>1Password</h3>\n\n<p>All sensetive information gets put into the vault. The feature that galvanised this solution for me is the ability to add multiple attachments to any account or item. As such all of my bank statements get added in there, fully encrypted and ready to be accessed on the go if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3>Evernote</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://evernote.com\">Evernote</a> is the latest addtion to my organisational workflow. I have to wonder why I didn&rsquo;t try this suite before. Actually <em>scrap that</em>, I did try this suite out years ago but I just couldn&rsquo;t get into the version at the time. The biggest advantage for me is the fact that multiple types of data can be combined into a single note. I can have a pdf, with a link, a note and a zip file all in a single note for easy review and access.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a while to get everything in here, but I have faith that once it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll be able to access things much faster.</p>\n\n<h3>Simplenote</h3>\n\n<p>This is my scratchpad. <a href=\"http://simplenote.com\">Simplenote</a> is used for all those pieces of information that are not sensetive in anyway but that would be useful being accessed quickly.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>A few months after publishing the last episode of <em>Moon Racket</em> Season One, I&rsquo;ve now finished writing the second season. If the first season was all about seeing a project through to completion, the second season is taking the idea and adding some polish.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve always enjoy watching is the natural maturing process a body of work sometimes goes through while the creative minds behind the work hone their skills. Although I can only dream of reaching the lofty heights reached by a series like <em>The Simpsons</em>, an apt comparison in one regard would be how the first season looked compared to what we recognise as the characters now. There was a maturing process and this is something that I aim to achieve for Season Two, both for the writing and the art.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>I&rsquo;ve already spoken about the proposed increase in paper size (and therefore <a href=\"http://brokenkode.com/post/78836757301/panel-size\">Panel Size</a>) of the coming season. One thing I realised very quickly was just how important the initial scripts were. The first season had a bit of looseness in the scripts. I would often times rewrite the thing as I was drawing it - sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>For this season I decided to really pour into the details of every script. I would not go on to the next one until I actually had completed the one I was working on. If I got stuck on any one strip, I would remove it from the document I was working on and paste it into a second document that acted as my &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo;. This allowed me to focus on one strip at a time. What I realised was that some ideas took days, weeks to mature or develop in my head and other ideas effectively wrote themselves. What I also realised was the last 5 episodes were extremely difficult to complete, which might have been a mental block on my side, or the fact that I had a lot going on in my life at the time.</p>\n",

It was a method for me to actually use my latest &lsquo;computer&rsquo; to create content, rather than just consume on it.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious limitation was the size of the screen, so I decided to use this as the panel size (or at least the same aspect ratio 3:2) with the idea that eventually when I release the series digitally, it will already be formatted for this screen size.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/15527be017.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I realised pretty quickly that although I was getting the benefit of colour and I was using my iPhone, the creation process was stifling and the end result wasn&rsquo;t as consistent as I would have liked. I decided to take the strip back to the physical world and made the investment in an A4 hardcover art book with thick paper - no idea what the grade is, but it was reasonably smooth (not bristol board smooth). It was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. All of <em>Moon Racket</em> lives in this A4 book.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/417fa9555f.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Traditionally the newspaper industry and therefore the artform itself, comic strips are typically 4 panels, 4 inches by 3 inches. In an attempt to grow, Season Two will be framed with the typical 3:4 ratio panels. I&rsquo;ve had to get some American sized paper, 11x14 inches, which frustratingly is slightly larger than A4 but smaller than A3 - and means I can no longer use my A4 book.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this change will mean that the art will breathe more and therefore should allow the strip to better shine.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/1eeee5b7cd.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

All 20 episodes were released every Sunday for 20 weeks. Secondly, the general reaction on both <a href=\"http://facebook.com/moonracket\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://moonracket.com\">Tumblr</a> have been really great and I&rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has liked, shared or read the strip. I&rsquo;m still debating whether or not <a href=\"http://tapastic.com/series/moonracket\">Tapastic</a> is worth it, but I do it for the 3 that have subscribed and hopefully enjoying the strip.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I give the strips an overall <strong>5/10</strong>. There are some stories that I think worked out better than others but the truth is I could have written better stories and could have developed the characters better.</p>\n\n<p>One aspect that I am genuinely happy with is the <em>evolution</em> of the artwork. I still think it&rsquo;s ok and only the errors jump out at me, but at least I can see a proper improvement over the life of the strip.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind the series is going to take a break for a few months while I write better stories (currently I have 10 in the bag) and come back stronger with Season Two.</p>\n",

Each project has it&rsquo;s own notebook where most things can be found.</p>\n\n<p>One sketch that I attribute the inking of <a href=\"http://www.moonracket.com\">Moon Racket</a> to, is the original icon sketch for the app.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/2bd6f881a3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The importance of this sketch was in making me appreciate the Muji 0.38mm black gel ink pen as a tool for clean inking and providing the correct thickness of line that I was originally looking for - but couldn&rsquo;t really achieve with my Copic pens.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/a6e0e965e6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>While this pen isn&rsquo;t completely suitable for the clean lined artwork of <em>Chroma</em>, it still has it&rsquo;s uses for all the cross-hatching required. Sometimes you stumble on a tool that elevates your art, for me it was my Muji gel ink pen.</p>\n",

Surprisingly the comic work didn’t end there as I completely rewrote the script for <em>Chroma</em> (my upcoming comics project) that has been many years in the making.</p>\n\n<p>I redesigned this here site for the umpteenth time, however I do believe that this iteration is by far my most mature attempt and probably one that I will likely not change fundamentally for many years to come. The aspects of the site that I am most happy with are the colours and the typography, which is the first time in many years that I am ahead of the curve in certain respects (small caps only valid in certain browsers, surprisingly not Safari/Webkit proper).</p>\n\n<p>Finally I started work on two iOS apps. The first one, we’ve scrapped and shelved, the other I hope we get some traction in the new year and we finally ship something, because as we all know:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Real Artists Ship.</p>\n<p>— <cite>Steve Jobs</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s wishing everyone a great 2014.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol><li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>This year I started getting into photography a little bit more.

In a last attempt to keep the name and the site alive I tried changing things around to see if I could maintain my enthusiasm for it.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt was to try and focus on all things Tesla Motors. However I quickly realised that actually I was writing to an audience of one (myself) and that I wasn’t enjoying the process all that much. My next idea was to use the site as a simple Tumblr, a digital drawer for things that others created. My attempts can still be read <a href=\"http://khaledaboualfa.tumblr.com\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I felt that the site deserved better treatment. In the last few months I have started publishing my comic work, on <a href=\"http://www.moonracket.com\">Moon Racket</a> and I have several other projects in the pipeline as well. So this site will be used as a way to log my ideas and showcase the creative process, in the attempt to better understand what I am doing and how I could be doing it better. The posts on this site will be more limited, however each and every one will be infinitely more <em>personal</em>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Since I got married (nearly 3 years ago) I&rsquo;ve put on around 10kg (around 1.5 stone or 22 pounds). Yeah that&rsquo;s a lot. I don&rsquo;t blame my lovely wife for this additional weight, but rather a combination of my lifestyle in the Middle East (very little required movement) and my body&rsquo;s very slow metabolism.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year I decided that enough was enough and that I would do something about this situation. Apart from general health issues associated with gaining the above weight, by wardrobe is useless, which then affects my general comfort/confidence levels as well.</p>\n\n<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>\n\n<p>Like any self respecting geek, I turned to my trustiest device to help me out, my iPhone 4. I tried several fitness apps, but settled on the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pacer-pedometer-plus-weight/id600446812?mt=8\">Pacer</a> app. While not the prettiest app, it gave me basic information, the number of steps I was making and calories burned, in graph form, mapped over a week.</p>\n\n<p>I realised that having this information drove me to be more active. I have yet to achieve 10,000 steps a day. I average anywhere between 6000-8000 steps per week, however I realised that the exercise that I was doing was not being logged properly. My gym machines indicated a much higher level of activity, that my phone wasn&rsquo;t capturing.</p>\n\n<h3>All the Gear…</h3>\n\n<p>I decided to get a little bit more serious about this weight loss malarky. There was one thing to it, buy more gadgets that would help me achieve my goals, <em>obviously</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The first accessory that I bought was a pair of sweat proof earphones - I cannot tell you how many Apple earbuds I&rsquo;ve destroyed due to my excessive sweating over the years. The Sennheiser OCX 685i Sports headphones came <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-exercise-headphones/\">highly recommended</a> (and they are great).</p>\n\n<p>The next purchase was my <a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/uk/one\">Fitbit One</a>. The truth is I didn&rsquo;t jump into this world quickly. I used the Pacer app for a solid 2 months before making the jump into the Fitbit world. I&rsquo;m still getting to grips with the website and the app (although syncing with my current setup isn&rsquo;t as smooth as it could be <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> ), but I like what I see so far.</p>\n\n<p>The last part of my gear was a new set of scales. Actually, I&rsquo;ve not owned scales in 3 years, which probably explains a great deal for the general decent into obesity. So here&rsquo;s a tip kids, make sure you own scales and get on them once a week. If anything it will highlight things that you&rsquo;re generally scared of.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that the data that I compile will help me make better decisions in the kitchen (after all a diet starts in the kitchen) and that it will motivate me to be more active, more regularly, even if only a little more every day.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr /><ol><li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>The biggest bummer is that my trusted iPhone 4 since it does not support wireless sync with the Fitbit One. I&rsquo;m therefore relegated to using the little dongle connected to my computer - hardly the biggest hardship. <a href=\"1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol></div>\n",

I have a name for it, called the Hyperloop.<br />\n  — Elon Musk</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop\"><em>Hyperloop</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a world where travelling from San Francisco to Los Angeles takes less than 30 minutes. A method of transportation which is <em>meant</em> to be 4 times as fast as a train, and 2 times as fast as a plane. Now imagine this method of transport is available to you as soon as you arrive — no waiting for everyone else to get there. That’s the future that Elon Musk is proposing with his hypothetical high-speed transportation system. Details for this system are extremely thin on the ground. In fact, apart from the name and a few choice quotes (by Musk himself) nothing substantial has been published or released about the concept;</p>\n\n<p>Although Musk was meant to <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/19/elon-musk-on-hyperloop\">publish a paper</a> on it back in December 2012. That has now been pushed back to the 12th of August 2013, according to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4524726/elon-musk-will-reveal-plans-for-hyperloop-august-12th\">this tweet</a> by Musk. The Verge has an <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/18/4534476/how-will-elon-musks-hyperloop-work\">interesting article</a> on how they believe the system could potentially work.</p>\n\n<p>However until Musk releases his Alpha design documents, there is no real engineering to review.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>The first time Hyperloop was discussed was in this interview on <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2012/07/12/pandomonthly-presents-a-fireside-chat-with-elon-musk/\">Pandodaily</a>, with Sarah Lacy. Based on the little that has been shared, one might think that Musk’s idea will be akin to something like the ‘tube’ transportation system in Futurama or The Jetsons. Many of the ideas (commercial space travel, commercial electric cars) that Musk discusses could have been taken straight out of science fiction novels. The reason you should take these ideas seriously, is because he makes those ideas a reality.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2018/db6ca643d4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Musk’s idea doesn’t appear to be completely unique (as opposed to the science fictious world). <a href=\"http://couldthishappen.com/?p=381\">Joelle Renstrom</a>, (who teachs at Boston University) has a good breakdown of the realities of this technology. One such reality is the Aeromovel. The other is the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McpWcn-1RZU\">Evacuated Tube Transport</a> a system that has been proposed by the <a href=\"http://www.et3.com/\">ET3 consortium</a>. The main question is therefore how does his proposed system differ.</p>\n\n<p>As if the potential of this idea wasn’t intriguing enough; the way that Musk’s idea could become a reality is equally as intriguing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’m considering just open-sourcing. Describing the idea, saying this is what would be done, if someone wants to do it then they could do it. Maybe I should patent it and open-source the patent to anyone who can make a credible case that they can do it.<br />\n  — Elon Musk</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it’s safe to acknowledge that Elon Musk sees the world in a different way to most people. Probably one of the best articles I’ve read about him, is unsurprisingly on <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-13/elon-musk-the-21st-century-industrialist\">Bloomberg</a>. Between commercial space travel, electric cars and pneumatic transportation, he is building the future that we were expecting. The future we dreamed we would be living in, when we got older.</p>\n",

Thankfully developers all over the world responded to this (stupid) business decision(?) and provided a slew of alternatives. There really is a great deal of choice, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>My preferred solution is probably a reasonably popular one, in that I’m using <a href=\"http://Feedbin.me\">Feedbin</a> as my backend. This connects to <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on iOS and <a href=\"http://readkitapp.com/\">Readkit</a> on my Mac. One of the <em>main</em> reasons for choosing Feedbin however is linked to the excellent implementation of the website which is incredibly slick (I need this, as my work machine is Windows based).</p>\n\n<p>The thing that definitely made me smile however is just how quickly the developer community moved to provide good alternatives that lost nothing from the features provided by Google Reader and in fact held more promise than the stagnant Reader.</p>\n\n<p>Although the RSS feed reader market is ‘old’, it’s a completely nascent one - which means that the best is yet to come.</p>\n",

I decided to keep a razor sharp focus on Tesla news and engineering in general. The model I was trying to on Daring Fireball - not a terribly original idea admittedly but I thought that as time would go on the site would evolve or die based on its own success and failure.</p>\n\n<p>In those 3 months I honestly saw extremely limited traction of people visiting the site, reblogging or liking a post. In fact a total of 3 people actually follow the site - hi guys, thanks for following. Then earlier this week I posted my first image. That single post has generated more action than the entire site has had in the 3 months since the relaunch.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an 'event&rsquo; that I can&rsquo;t ignore, as clearly I&rsquo;m not reaching the desired audience on Tumblr - which I know exists. What I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s me, not you. Tumblr knows what it is. The users know what they want out of Tumblr; I however thought that I could use the platform in a different way. The platform is clearly suited to a specific kind of content, one which isn&rsquo;t text heavy.</p>\n",

A quick search online and found a picture of its flagship product, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(electric_car)\">Coda</a>. Yeah, exactly what I thought, pretty damn fugly. Clearly I wasn&rsquo;t alone as the company <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-01/demise-of-coda-automotive-means-lonelier-electric-car-owners\">sold 100 cars in total</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What amuses me about the comparisons to Tesla, is how misguided and wrong those comparisons actually are. Sure they both make (or in Coda&rsquo;s case, <em>made</em>) electric cars, but that&rsquo;s as far as I could see the similarities ending.</p>\n\n<p>People who&rsquo;ve never seen a Model S in real person, lust after it. Tesla make a single vehicle at the moment. They&rsquo;ve stopped production on the Roadster and the focus is on a single product. They are focusing on this model and increasing it&rsquo;s appeal - through continuous initiatives such as it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/true-cost-of-ownership\">leasing programme</a> and expanded <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger\">supercharger network</a>.

Each race lasts for 1 hour. The first car is used for 20 minutes, a second car is then used for the next 20 minutes, before returning to the first car (where the batteries have been recharged) for the final 20 minutes. The hope that 10 additional minutes are added per year to the range of the vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Formula 1 is the pinnacle of Motorsport. From this racing series, hundreds of (small and large) innovations have been added to road cars, as the teams fight for a competitive advantage and therefore innovate like crazy. Hopefully the Formula E series can do the same thing for Electric Vehicles and battery technology.</p>\n",
