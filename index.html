			 <h1 id="reading-in-2024">Reading in 2024</h1>
<p>9th of April was when it all happened. I walked into the public library to get a sheet of paper printed and left with a library card and 5 books under my arm. This then opened the door wide for me to borrow and read 38 books this year.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago seeing some others online ‘claiming’ that they had read 40 books or more in a year and I honestly didn’t believe it was possible.</p>
<p>This year I found out how. When the price entry to a good book is free, then it can become a source of incredible joy (and knowledge) and 40 books is really not that large of a mountain to climb.</p>
<p>The beauty of course is that I am not limited to one way of ‘reading’. This year was the first time that I enjoyed a few audiobooks as well. As long as I am in North America, I have access to whatever I want (not always at exactly the time I want, but that’s ok).</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>2024 was a lot of things to me and most people I imagine. One thing I believe is that 2024 was not <em>kind</em>. The genocide in Palestine at the hands of the racist imperialist Israeli ethnostate (enabled and supported in full by the morally bankrupt Western governments) remains a particularly harrowing episode in our collective history as humans. These demons in Israel have lost their humanity. Human beings are not meant to do these atrocities to other humans, and certainly not celebrate it while doing it. If you’re an Israeli, or an Israeli-sympathiser that condones the slaughter of babies, children, women and men then you have also lost your humanity and I hope that your way of thinking is something that can be eradicated in the near future. You are the worst of what humanity had to offer in 2024, or even in the last 50 years - and you had a lot of competition. I wish you nothing but misery in all aspects of your life.</p>
<p>American politics continues to fall further down the toilet. Stupidity and social engineering at a mass scale has finally yielded the results that its creators intended. Total unaccountability and chaos to do what is right. People who barely have a grasp of the issues are being given weapons they don’t know what to do with.</p>
<p>Lebanon’s regular 20 year pummelling continues without missing a beat. Every fucking 20 years. I can’t recall a more unfortunate series of events, spanning decades, happening to a tiny collection of dirt. There will always be resistance to evil. The Israelis (and their sympathisers) seem to have forgotten this very simple fact.</p>
<p>All these events have played their toll on me. I am less able to function apart from work. My enthusiasm for my projects feel completely and utterly meaningless in the wake of some serious shit that is happening around the world, to people I care about. This has happened to me before. Part of me is broken, but I want to do something about it.</p>
<p>For 2025, my theme is <em>kindness</em>. Kindness to myself. Kindness to those around me. Kindness to those further away. We could all do with a little bit more kindness.</p>

			 <p>It took a minute - well actually it took around 7 years - but I finally got the site where I want it across text, <a href="/photos">photos</a> and my <a href="/bookshelf">bookshelf</a>. The last two pages have been annoying me for years but it was <em>fine</em> until this morning when it was bloody not fine anymore. I also tweaked the colours a little so that they are both neutral both in normal and dark modes.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years of playing around with websites I have wondered to myself why I bother spending time tweaking and fixing and sweating the pixel details. I’m not alone in this space as clearly many, many others have the same tinkering itch. It’s an itch that you can’t help but scratching away at. Leave it alone and it will be fine. Not that I spent ages over the last 7 years playing with the design (I would tweak once or twice a year), but my feeling now is that unless there is a major shift in what I do with my site, the design will remain consistent and the same for many, many years to come.</p>

The concepts being Japanese design by way of hodo-hodo. Tiny little book with short essays that showcased the designers thoughts. Loved it because it celebrated some of the best of what I feel is Japanese culture.</p>

			 <p>For the last 5 weeks we have been hitting the Toronto pavements in search for a house. It’s been a brutal experience. What has surprised me sometimes is the level of mess that we have encountered in some of the homes we have visited. I mean in some cases it’s been really eye opening to see how some people choose to surround themselves with <em>stuff</em>. So. Much. Stuff.</p>
<p>I am a distance from being a true minimalist (or someone who has enough), but so many out there could really do with some Marie Kondo advice.</p>

<p>I just got back from New York and still letting the whole experience unpack itself out of my brain. I’ve flown into Newark airport countless times but we would then head in the other direction towards Princeton. This time was different, we landed in Newark and headed east. As we approached the Manhattan Island, the landscape was a very familiar American highways construction. Looping freeways, lawyer billboards hugged the edges of the roads. The road twisted inbetween trees, that felt different to the ones we have in Canada, these were shorter in stature.</p>
<p>The first real signs of what was to come unveiled itself as we took the bend just before entering the Lincoln tunnel. I caught a glimpse of Bjarke Ingel’s VIA 57 West building (I had no idea what the thing was called but knew of the building). What I didn’t realise was that I was also looking at Hell’s Kitchen<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The view lasted a split second. I tried to grab my phone and take a pick, but the moment was over as we quickly turned into the Lincoln tunnel.</p>
<p>When we emerged on the other side, the transition to a startling density came almost instantly. Looking outside the car window it took my eyes a little while to fully grasp what we were driving through. A hyper dense city where every block is fully occupied by a building structure from edge to edge. In front of the buildings a slender pavement wraps around the structure. The biggest shock however was the limited space between the roads. The streets could barely fit one car down the centre, with another car width on either side for drop offs and pick ups - or as was exceedingly common, construction.</p>
<p>As we made our way through the chaos, the logistics of making this place function in a reasonable manner began to present themselves in real time. Life here would require an understanding of consequences and compromises. We were instantly given a demonstration. Traffic was bumper to bumper, blocked on all sides. And then an ambulance siren was heard behind us. There was literally nowhere to go. Intersection crossings had to be respected but there was no flexibility to allow emergency vehicles to pass.</p>
<h2 id="the-grid">The Grid</h2>
<p>What totally captured my imagination was the grid. Not only the audacity to create something like this, but also the ability to implement and maintain this grid. It created a space unlike anything I have ever seen. My mind has accepted that cities were messy, organic constructions. Roads wind around as we built things sometimes around the natural world that existed. Sometimes we would tame the land to suit our very specific needs. The common element was that there was no consistent order within them.</p>
<p>Here however was an island that seemed completely flat and where there was a complete embodiment of a grid that was then turned up to the max by building straight up. I have lived in dense areas in my life, but this order to density to scale was a unique combination.</p>
<p>Someone had to wrangle this defining city element into existence. I had to find out more. Thankfully <a href="https://thegreatestgrid.mcny.org/greatest-grid/">The Museum of the City of New York</a> has collected all this information to celebrate and educate on this very unique city design aspect.</p>
<h2 id="general-observations">General Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Another defining element of what I imagined New York to be are all the elements that define a city. The yellow cabs were still there, but they did not occupy the same vibrancy I had previously imagined.</li>
<li>The entrances to the subway stations were inconspicuous, and was missing it’s own identity. Unlike the Metros in Europe there was no unifying sign that invited you in and announced itself. Rather New York has green railing with signs attached to the railings. To my mind this was a missed opportunity.</li>
<li>New York is a <em>very</em> live musical city. In the lobby of the hotel, on the short cruise boat that took us around, across Broadway avenue leading up to Time Square. Live music was everywhere.</li>
<li>It’s very difficult to truly appreciate massive structures from up close. So in NY your viewing angles are limited.</li>
<li>The body traffic was something I had not experienced since I was last in Asia.</li>
<li>Walking north/south (so crossing streets) became a little annoying. It felt like I was always walking and hitting a red light. Every. Single. Time. Maybe that’s just being in New York for the first time and it feels like that for everyone?</li>
<li>Its hard to explain, but this density and complete use of every portion of the available grid made it feel <em>less</em> real, made it feel like a theme park.</li>
<li>There was a little bit of self-importance on display by the locals. ‘Greatest City on Earth’. ‘Mega exclusive club’.  ‘Insanely expensive apartment’. This is the kind of language that I have experienced in nearly every city I have been to (apart from the greatest city on earth moniker, that is reserved for American arrogance).</li>

			 <p>Honestly I’m finding it hard to concentrate on my own passions and hobbies because they feel so trivial in comparison to what is going on in Gaza and Lebanon. A building next door to my cousins supermarket got bombed this week. My cousin was in the building at the time. Aside from the destruction one of the girls at the cashiers died. The utter randomness of hurt and destruction continues unchecked.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vOzUmqv-s">Seeing this monologue by Mehdi Hasan</a> reminds me of what a <em>shit</em> choice people with a <em>conscience</em> have in the upcoming election in the US.</p>
<p>On the one hand you have a Democratic nominee that sees <em>absolutely</em> nothing wrong with what is going on in Gaza and Lebanon - and will continue to enable and support the genocide perpetrated by the 21st Century Nazis (that’s some fucking irony there). The colonialism and racism at play here is just astonishing. On the other hand you have a Republican, who also doesn’t see anything wrong with what is going on, but will likely ratchet up and expand the killing.</p>
<p>Both are distinctly odorous. Given the choice, which I obviously don’t have, I don’t know how I would use my vote. My view is that we collectively cannot stop the killing but what is happening right now, is inhumane and must never be forgotten, by myself or anyone with a moral fibre in their bodies.</p>
<p>The sooner work can be begin to isolate Israel from the world, in the same way  the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_South_Africa_during_apartheid">world did to South Africa</a> during the apartheid, the better.</p>

			 <p>While the situation in the Middle East is absolutely deplorable and shows a chasm of epic proportions between the ruling elite and what they think is acceptable based on race.</p>
<p>It’s <em>not</em> ok if you’re Ukrainian.
It’s <em>totally</em> fine and necessary if you’re Palestinian or Lebanese.</p>
<p>I am however heartened by the voices of people I genuinely look up to and listen to or watch. Journalists, writers, activists, helpers, volunteers, parents, mothers and fathers who are not going quietly and accepting this situation.</p>
<p>The latest being Ta Nehisi Coates and Trevor Noah. These people have huge platforms and bring with them a great deal of attention. My hope is that some of that attention is converted into meaningful change.</p>
<p>From a moral standpoint, this genocide will not be completed for as long as there is one Palestinian or Lebanese, then there will always be resistance to cowardice, brutality and inhumanity.</p>

The number of Israelis that lost their lives in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>The multiplier is 40 (as of October 2024). That is how much more <em>expensive</em> an Israeli life is compared to a Palestinian one. The racial supremacy at play here is simply astounding. This is not ok. This is not right. You cannot carry out or enable genocide and have any moral standing.</p>

			 <p>To Joe Biden,</p>
<p>Shame on you.<br>
The world deserves a better world leader.</p>
<p>You’ve managed to make sure that Iran is the only power, in the entire world, that is willing to stand up to the morally deplorable and callous Israeli government. Even if it’s fruitless or for show at least <em>someone</em> is bothered to take action rather than ignore the genocide being committed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you, the United State’s elected leader (which even with your stupid electoral college garbage still means the <em>majority</em> of Americans who bothered to vote), stand behind and support a regime that has only death on their minds. I cannot believe the <em>majority</em> of Americans believe that this genocide is just.</p>
<p>The Palestinians and Lebanese and Syrians and Yemenis and Iranians did not cause the holocaust, but critically they are paying for it in the <em>same</em> manner.</p>
<p>Back in the 1940s America stepped in to stop humanity’s madness. America has now switched roles and is the proxy enabler of the madness.</p>
<p>Politically you are retiring in 2 months, why wouldn’t you take a stand and do what’s right? You have nothing to loose. You’re nearly dead anyway. Before you have no power left, save some lives, even if they are filthy Arab and Persian ones.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593714034">The Algebra of Wealth</a> by Scott Galloway 📚. This one was an extension of Scott’s previous book I just finished. However it does go deeper into many economic concepts (so at least you can’t claim ignorance). ETFs similar to mutual index funds are a major part of the answer, but equally there is a lot there about buying property and hopefully using wealth at different times of your life to help you lead a better life. It’s a great book and one I wish I had when I was starting my working life.</p>
<p>More over having someone guide me around these economic constructs (that I honestly have previously had little to no interest in) is another important element in this. I sadly did not have that growing up and until recently didn’t have the inclination to find out more. This is a good book to get you on this journey.</p>

			 <p>There was a time that I would watch the Apple infomercial when it came out. Even be excited about it. I can’t remember a time I was less interested in what Apple has just released. From a computing standpoint I’m good. iPhone Pro has hopefully years of service in it. My 2018 iPad Pro is still a compelling device, 6 years after it was released. My Mac Mini is chugging along, kicking ass and taking names.</p>
<p>The only take I have is that the Apple Watch is slowly turning into a device that I don’t <em>hate</em>. It’s getting thinner and more rounded and less of a mental burden. It’s only taken them 10 editions to get there.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been thinking a little about how I can take in more information from the non-fiction books I read. The first tip I’m going to try is <a href="https://fs.blog/blank-sheet-method/">The Blank Sheet Method</a>. The second thing that I’ve discovered is the excellent scanning/OCR feature of the Notes.app. It’s not 100% perfect, but honestly I can deal with the occasional missed word or two. Just one note with the key parts of the book scanned and searchable for the future.</p>
<p>Anyone have any other low friction tips to share?</p>

			 <p>Big fan of Ottolenghi cook books. I’ve used a few of the recipes recently (one today in fact) and it’s exactly the kind of colour and flavour that I absolutely love. The thing is that these books actually benefit from being physical items rather than entries into an app like Mela (which I love). I tend not to buy many books anymore, because of the whole Toronto Public Library thing, but I might make an exception for these books.</p>

Nothing majorly new in this book (for anyone that has been paying to Newport’s podcast, but its nice to find out about all these stories.

			 <p>Even after reading <em>The Simple Path to Wealth</em>, it is clear that across all the different countries and their regulations (and bullshit), governments want to keep you poor. If this was simple then everyone would be able to do it pretty quickly. Rather even after someone tries to decipher it all, there is still an immense amount of friction that intentionally makes things harder. It&rsquo;s even harder for those of us who enjoy a more mobile serial emigrant lifestyle.</p>
<p>Having lived and worked in seven countries, finding a place that will allow me to invest and keep things mobile is actually an exceedingly small number. The only one that I have found is <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/">Interactive Brokers</a> - that is available in all the countries I have ever lived and worked in. I don&rsquo;t know when they expanded into all these countries (or if they always operated in these countries), but this a massive win and feather in their cap.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t really comment on how good a service it is, but having the <em>ability</em> to move my investments wherever life takes me is a truly unique feature and worth other possible pain points.</p>
<p>The only other brokerage that came up in my limited search was Saxo (out of Denmark) and Charles Schwab, except BOTH are not available in Canada, so I would need to move everything over to Interactive Brokers if we ever decided to move.</p>

			 <p>My sleep has been truly terrible these last few weeks (months?). On the off chance that my phone had something to do with that, I bought this <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B0CLP1392Z?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title">Alarm Clock</a> (although any will do) and somehow I have been getting a full night’s sleep. It has been a stark and instant change. Now every night my phone which is pretty useful in my bedroom (controls the light and adjusts the temperature of the room) is relegated to being placed outside. Best possible life adjustment.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781737724100">The Simple Path to Wealth</a> by Jl Collins 📚. What a book. It is <em>extremely</em> US centric, but there are some clear truths here that just need to be adapted and massaged to reflect what is possible to me. I wish I had this book 20 years ago, but then most of the things he talks about would be unattainable in the countries I lived in…but not anymore. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get their financial life in order. Been going crazy sorting it out this weekend.</p>

			 <p>🇵🇸 Time will absolutely not look kindly on the US’s blinkered support of the atrocities in Gaza and more importantly Palestine in general.</p>
<p>Having a war criminal presented as a guest of the state is not a good look if you believe you are on the right side of plain human decency.</p>
<p>It may be half a world away, but this is happening with your support and backing in the face of what we can all agree is just humanly abhorrent. Sort it out. It’s just not right and while things have changed (within the US, as the Arab diaspora spreads), this has been ratcheted with even more brazen and unacceptable violations of human right we all can agree on for ourselves. I just don’t understand why this cannot be a consideration for other human beings?</p>

			 <p>Cobra Kai has been a pretty fun show to watch. When it’s great, it hits some really big highs. It suffer from some poor writing choices, but overall the momentum of the show is great.

I highly doubt they’ll make a spin off, hard to keep mining these characters.</p>

			 <p>Another great series by Ed Brubaker. <em>Friday</em> is as good as you expect it to be. Setting it in the 1970s in a fishing town provides the right kind of atmosphere. Marcos Martin brings an incredible clarity to the environment that they are depicting. Just an absolute joy of a series and super excited that the third book in the series is released this summer.</p>

			 <p>Finally got a replacement television for the family. We’ve been using a pretty old Sony Bravia for nearly 9 years now. That’s like 46 in television years.</p>
<p>It always felt like there was something more important to buy than a television. If the old was working, what was the point right? Well the old one stopped working, or at least the volume associated with  voices and it became pretty unbearable.</p>
<p>I opted for an LG this time around, mainly on the back of WebOS (although not sure how they’ve ported the old Palm OS to televisions) and the price to features ratio.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that my kids have grown up with this one television for the entire life and I imagine they will have the same memories that I have for my family television set with the wood panelling and grey control panel for the 1980s.</p>

			 <p>📚 Just finished the second volume of <em>A Distant Neighbourhood</em>. I always knew that the work of Jiro Taniguchi would resonate (based on his artwork alone), but hadn’t realised how much better his work is for me now that I am in my 40s with a family of my own. The beats hit <em>harder</em>. All the things that attract me to life in Japan in the 60s are all present, but now the situations feel infinitely more relatable. Master of his craft and thankfully he has left a massive body of work to loose yourself in.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781409080497">Two Brothers</a> by Ben Elton 📚. A truly difficult book to get through, mainly because of the parallels I can see unfolding between what the Israelis are doing to the Palestinians. The mechanics are different, but the result is the same. One group of people with power trying to wipe another group of people from the earth. The irony is too strong for me to handle without spiralling into a dark place (which is why I don’t like to write about this).</p>

			 <p>It’s been such a long time that I’ve <em>really</em> gotten into a novel. <em>Silo</em> was great, and only got better after I had finished ‘Season One’ of the show, but Ben Elton’s <em>Two Brothers</em> has been a thick slab of greatness. It’s also a really sad read considering this book starts 100 years ago and history repeats itself by the ancestors of the victims.</p>

The more I spent looking at the list the more I realised that what I might actually want to consider is focusing on those projects that could have the maximum impact to those around me, which will then enable me to continue to meander and create more things in the future, because of the knowledge that I am not just creating these things for myself and a few devotees who appreciate and get what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I have poured a lot of myself into my the two books I’ve released, <a href="https://www.stet.build/bec">Built Environment Compendium Volume.1</a> and <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/moonracket/">Moon Racket! Ambient Hum</a>. And while I believe that they’re good packages, sadly they have not penetrated an audience. Life is anything but a series of failures that we build upon and learn from. I genuinely believe that we should never dwell on failures. The work that I’ve created is mostly evergreen. You can read it now and in 10 years time and it will be (mostly) relevant.</p>
<p>So with that I have decided to focus my efforts on the following projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>How We Design and Build Our Environment</li>
<li><a href="https://stet.substack.com">Stet Newsletter</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first project is a <em>something</em> I have been meaning to develop since the summer. It’s partly a manual for all those looking to enter the construction industry but I am hoping to create a number of things that will look to enhance this project. The ultimate aim is to create a really useful resource for those interested to get a better understanding before they dive in and make considered decisions.</p>
<p>The <em>Stet</em> newsletter is going to be a different affair this time around as well. Rather than massive article that delves into a specific topic, I am going to collect different items of interest over the course of a month, sprinkle some commentary and send these out. This time however I am going to leverage LinkedIn this time around as I felt had the most interaction on that platform as it has a larger concentration of the <em>type</em> of people that are more likely interested in this kind of thought.</p>
<p>As I delve into the above, I will likely review and develop two other projects that are actually at a reasonably advanced stage of development, Automated Construction and Built Environment Compendium Vol.2. These projects can ultimately act as feeders into the newsletter while also exercising a different type of creative activity.</p>

			 <h2 id="a-flag-for-me">A Flag for Me</h2>
<p><em>Emigrant: a person who leaves their own country in order to settle permanently in another.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This particular image of Pangea<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <a href="https://capitan-mas-ideas.blogspot.com/2012/08/pangea-politica.html">image made the rounds over a decade ago</a> and has always stuck with me as a powerful <em>idea</em> given form. A world that is seemingly freed from <em>natural</em> borders. Squint a little and you can almost completely imagine the manmade borders blending away into nothingness. This is the world that I wished existed with respect to allowing people a way to roam and discover and make better lives for themselves.</p>
<p>When everything is interconnected, there is no possible way for you to be able to patrol or even try and control borders. It would be a completely useless exercise, in the way that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis">Europe discovered back in 2015</a>.</p>
<p>How would this world have developed differently with these new proximities and new borders. Imagine having the opportunity to travel across Pangea. What an incredible tapestry of human discovery that would allow. Then imagine the connectivity that would be possible. Would the world feel smaller or larger? Would we feel more connected or distant to each other?</p>
<p>At this moment in our collective existence, Earth does not resemble Pangea. Earth is separated by oceans, rivers and mountains. Humanity broke through these barriers, first across the sea and then in the air. Sadly humanity then decided to build other barriers in their place. First in the form of barricades walls and more recently in the form of paperwork and immigration laws.</p>
<p>To create a sense of unity for a collection of people, boundaries were drawn on a map and a flag is drawn high in the air to help those feel further connected. It’s a strong and emotive piece of design that connects a culture and represents ideologies and shared histories. People rally around the flag because it helps them visualise something otherwise nebulous and difficult to explain. Us. This flag represents Us, not them.</p>
<p>As I have travelled the world, I have tried to experience Pangea in my own way. It’s seemingly not as smooth if all the bodies of water were connected but I have been allowed to roam. In that movement I have strayed increasingly further away from the flags (and cultures) of my childhood. For a while I hoped to adopt a flag from any one of the countries I have lived in, only to realise that this was ultimately a futile effort. As my time in each country drew to an end so did the flags glow in my life.</p>
<p>For years I have wanted a flag to rally around that I can take with me wherever I went. A flag for <em>emigrants</em> like myself. During the last decade, a couple of new flag designs have been released to great fanfare that ultimately did not fulfil this gap for me.</p>
<h3 id="the-refugee-nation-flag">The Refugee Nation Flag</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When it was released a few years ago, I thought that the <a href="http://www.therefugeenation.com/">refugee flag</a> perfectly captured the essence of something that anyone escaping their country on a boat would forever relate to. Clearly however this particular flag was not something that really represented my pampered emigration lifestyle.</p>
<p>As much as I love this design and what it means, it is not my flag.</p>
<h3 id="the-international-flag-of-planet-earth-ifpe">The International Flag of Planet Earth (IFPE)</h3>
<p>I was excited for a while to see the International Flag for Planet Earth making the rounds several years ago. However the purpose of the flag, while novel and awesome, addressed a purpose I was not looking for. This is for a future Star Trek world that has moved beyond some of the very basic issues that we are currently grappling with back here on Earth.</p>
<p>I love the deep blue colour. The symbology in the middle however is a little lost on me. It’s not emotive enough to capture my imagination (in say the same way that the Olympic rings definitely do, although I certainly prefer the monochrome rings rather than the original coloured version).</p>
<p>This flag was also something that didn’t address my needs either.</p>
<h3 id="the-flag-of-pangea">The Flag of Pangea</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From my own perspective, I have settled on the fact that I am a proud serial emigrant. A subtle nuance that likely nobody <em>really</em> cares about but one that I am more than happy to make and shout about.</p>
<p>And so, I challenged myself to create a flag that represents <em>people like me</em>. People who look to break through both natural and manmade boundaries and barriers that have been erected. A flag that represents people that move from one  country boundary to the next. A flag that represents <em>emigrants</em> and those travelling the world as though it were Pangea.</p>
<p>This flag is not intended for a state with borders. This flag is meant to be flown by those of us who travel the Earth, emigrating from one place to another.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-flag-stand-for">What does the flag stand for?</h2>
<p>The flag itself is represented by 3 specific design elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Colour</li>
<li>The Compass</li>
<li>The Angle</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-colour-blue">The Colour Blue</h3>
<p>The colour blue signifies freedom. The freedom to move and the freedom to travel across the world.</p>
<p>The colour blue also signifies our planet. It signifies the blue seas and blue skies of travel that allow you to make significant moves as an emigrant.</p>
<p>Going for a blue colour was not a difficult decision. While I did play around with a few colour ideas, the only question in my mind was what shade of blue I would decide upon. I did consider playing around with gradients, but that would likely break a few <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4">vexillological rules</a>. It’s not the first blue coloured flag in the world, and certainly not the first with white accents on it. I did flirt with the idea of having it a darker blue but felt it gave off too much of a Scotland vibe which is not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>In the end I decided to concentrate on the colours that calms me the most. The blue you see on a clear day. Not a cloud in the sky. The future beckoning you to explore the world that you live in.</p>
<h3 id="the-compass">The Compass</h3>
<p>The pointed cross symbolises the 4 points on a compass, North, East, South and West, signifying the ability to choose your path and overall destinations.</p>
<p>An important consideration for the design was replicating iconic flags like the Swiss flag. It has a design element that is bold, strong and easy to identify from far away. Contrast plays an important role in helping define the design. The key element on the flag went through several iterations. Originally I was considering using a circle to identify the Earth itself with the angle (more on this in a bit) creating an interesting juxtaposition of shapes and colours.</p>
<p>The issue was this it just was not <em>iconic</em> in any way. It did not offer the same level of contrast. I quickly settled onto adding a compass element. Testing this out with an 8 point star, this felt busy. Keeping it to 4 points felt right, but at the same time, too simple. It did not bring with it enough of a story. This is where I combined the best of the original ideas with the new compass element and put the compass at an angle (I promise I’m getting there).</p>
<p>The final piece was moving away from an abstract compass, into something that was a little more explicit. Adding the internal elements of a compass was something that was subtle enough but provided the right amount of character to make it crystal clear what the design was representing.</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle was deciding on the size of the compass itself. My original thought was to split the entire flag in half, thus accentuating the angle itself. Making this smaller looked better, as it better expressed that the world can stretch in all directions.</p>
<h3 id="234">23.4°</h3>
<p>How do you encompass everyone on the planet and their cultures that differ to vastly? By including a 23.4° angle. This angle mirrors the Earth’s axial tilt. One of the most important elements of science in our world that gives us our seasons and many (most?) of our <a href="https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/earths-tilt/">cultural ideas</a>. The angle is a celebration of our Earth and importantly the culture that we have created based on the gifts that it has provided.</p>

<p>Ultimately I want this symbol to be used by a community of Emigrants, like myself. I imagine a time when I will be able to offer physical representations of this design that can be used proudly.</p>

<p>I will be sharing all the files soon with a set of ways to use it proudly and spark the conversation.</p>
<p>My ultimate wish is that maybe sometime in the future we can live in a world that while does not represent Pangea physically, at least is open for people to travel freely. A place that represents the ideals of this flag. A place where I can finally answer the question, ‘Where are you from?’, with the simple answer, ‘I’m from here. I’m from Earth.’</p>

Otherwise you’ll be disappointing people that may or may not want to wait 4 months for something. Once you are outside the Kickstarter frame, you are meant to be a big boy, with big boy trousers.

			 <p>When I joined Micro.blog, over 7 years ago now, I rediscovered my love for writing on the web again. Micro.blog has a simple interface that doesn’t care what the number of characters you intend to use or whether you want to use a title or not. Just write and publish. The freedom was liberating.</p>
<p>This has worked well for me but I was recently finding that I would self regulate some of my output. I felt like sharing some random thoughts throughout the day which felt out of place on my site. I tend to like to capture certain kinds of thought that I share. Hobbies I am getting into. Discoveries I have made. Kid related activities. Things that I can come back to in the future and relive.</p>
<p>This other stream of thought felt more ephemeral. Fleeting. Captured because I will forget them and writing them and publishing them allows me to give them a little bit of weight. Last year I got a Status.lol account and this seemed to scratch this itch. The issue however was that I didn’t own the output. Enter Micro.blog’s new pricing model, I now have the option to have up to 5 sites. I sorted a <a href="https://status.kaa.bz">Status site</a> that does what my Status.lol was doing.</p>

			 <p>Been a while since I’ve listened to an episode of <em>Pod Save the World</em> - easily my favourite news related podcast. I have mixed feelings about the ongoing war in Ukraine (and Western rhetoric) when you juxtapose that against the war in Gaza. Both senseless and a tragedy to those in these countries. My issue is with the Western governments that support Ukraine and Israel at the same time. One is the aggressor while the other the one doing the aggression.</p>

It is a cross between a French press and an AeroPress, made from premium materials and looks to bridge a brewing gap between pour overs and espressos.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This review from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O24ErS50Q6k">Lance Hedrick</a> pits it against a whole bunch of alternative brewers trying to replicate the outcome (some using a similar-ish method, but none as elegant, or quite the same). The quick take is that while the profile can be replicated with other techniques/brewers, none as elegant as the BIRD.</p>
<p>It is currently out of stock- which does not come as a surprise. Smaller businesses, whether they are micro-brand watches, stationary, iPhone accessories or in this case coffee brewers typically have this issue if they have anything remotely successful.</p>

Firstly, they are the Apple Maps guide to coffee (already bookmarked a few places in Toronto), and there is a book, <a href="https://sprudge.com/newrules">The New Rules of Coffee</a>, that I’ve just ordered as well (breaking my no new books until I’ve finished reading other books on my list self imposed rule of 2024).</p>

			 <h1 id="year-of-health">Year of Health</h1>
<p>Although not written about this, until now, 2024 is my year of health. I’m in my 40s so it’s important that I give this aspect of my life the care and attention it deserves. Health includes mental and physical health, but for the moment there is a little bit of a focus on the physical side of things. I am looking to introduce key products that can slowly help me in this direction.</p>
<p>The first was a smart digital scale. What’s fascinating to me about this technology is that it’s able to record my BMI, water content and a slew of other data points.</p>
<p>The one data point that has really stuck with me is my metabolic age data point. Needless to say my body is indicated as older than I <em>actually</em> am. This single data point is enough motivation for me to really take my health super seriously.</p>
<p>The other data point is my water levels. Not a surprise I have less water than is within the ‘normal’ zone. So I’ve gone and bought a YETI bottle (the large one) so that I can keep guzzling water throughout the day.</p>
<p>For both of these things I’m going to concentrate on tracking trends. Don’t care how much, just as long as everything is trending in the right direction.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>The Antidote</em> is an interesting book, but only when the author is writing about his experiences with different people or going on an adventure to find out more. The journalist pieces are what came through as the strongest (or certainly the most interesting) parts of this book.</p>
<p>One thing that I have found myself tiring of, is the style of writing that is forever quoting random pieces of work, or sayings or whatever from people around the world, across time to enforce a point. It bores me because there is plenty of examples in the opposite direction. The occasional, important quote that is central might be acceptable but the barrage is tiring. I’ve found Ryan Holiday is the king of this style of writing, which is why I’ve not picked up his latest book.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I think this book serves as the planting of the ideas for his next book, <em>Four Thousand Weeks</em> which delves even further into our mortality, a subject that is clearly on the author’s mind.</p>

			 <p>A very anaemic amount of books this year. I am in the middle of several books at the moment, but my heart was just not into it this year I guess. The silver lining being it was better than the previous year. This year I&rsquo;m aiming for 1 book a month.</p>

			 <p>While I only just scraped by 2023 reading goals, I’ve decided to go down a very different route for 2024. In 2024, I will not buy any new books. Rather I have 12 lovely books that I bought over the years, that I either never finished or never started. I also have a few books that I need to reread to extract information from. So here’s the 2024 list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Life 3.0</li>
<li>After the Fall</li>
<li>Range</li>
<li>On Writing Well</li>
<li>A Job to Love</li>
<li>Brick by Brick</li>
<li>The Antidote</li>
<li>Adventures in Stationary</li>
<li>Creativity Inc</li>
<li>Messy</li>
<li>Unconditional Parenting</li>
<li>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</li>
</ol>
<p>The rereads are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Art and Business of Online Writing</li>
<li>Unnatural Talent</li>
</ol>
<p>In recent times I have found it pretty difficult to get into fiction, save for the <em>Silo</em> trilogy, which I am still working my way through and enjoying. I have not finished reading <em>Nausica</em> by Miyazaki or <em>Monsters</em> by Barry Windsor Smith, but am halfway through each of these.</p>

<p><em>Moon Racket!</em> is the story of two buddies living on the moon, making noise and eating cheese. It is also the story of my attempts at learning how to draw and write a comic series.</p>
<p>Comics as a medium has been a passion of mine since my early teens. Sadly I never really got around to the actual act of writing and drawing comics, rather spent time circling around the activity itself. And so it was that all of my previous attempts never amounted to any <em>completed</em> comic work - save a four page story for a Guardian/Observer newspaper comic competition called <em>Coffee Beans</em>. To help me fight through this inherent procrastination, the barrier for <em>Moon Racket!</em> was purposely set very low. The result was that for nearly a decade this world and it’s characters would be my main creative outlet. But lets start at the beginning.</p>
<p>At the start of 2010, I had a serious case of brain crack. Brain crack is a term coined by CGP Grey in an episode of the excellent podcast, <em>Hello Internet</em>, ‘…the longer we procrastinate on something we want to do, the more our brains build up expectations of how amazing it’s going to be. It’s like crack for your brain’. The project was based on an idea I had, after a hazy summer evening out in Athens when I was 21. I couldn’t let this idea go but I also couldn’t move it forward in a meaningful way either. Two events would enable me to break my brain free and allowed me to create my first real body of comic work.</p>
<p>Throughout the 2000s, my creative adventures had been spent developing and honing my web and graphic design skills. I had started life on the internet to help me publish my comic work, the issue was that I fell in love with the web itself. The web combined a lot of what I loved about comics in the first place, but in a vastly different format. The web in the early 2000s was an exciting place. I swam in this space for years until the internet landscape changed (which I attribute to Twitter and Facebook) and it stopped being exciting. Another piece of technology would also come out around this time that offered another creative avenue to explore, the iPhone. With the introduction of the iPhone 4, what was possible on this mini computer in your pocket was starting to expand. I decided that I would try and use this this $880 (the going rate with taxes) device to create a comic, each panel would be the size of the phone screen. While the idea was well conceived, it was beyond <em>ambitious</em>.</p>
<p>This entire series of characters was borne from a few images drawn on an iPhone 4 back in 2012. These were done using the crudest of styluses available at the time, which was a thin aluminium tube with a soft sponge attached to the end of it. The key elements of Corgan were there, the booties, long eyes and circles at all the joints. As I drew these characters, their world started to come into view for me. They lived on the moon. The moon was ostensibly made of cheese (and that would never run out of course). After realising that the little moon worm I had drawn was an organic being, he would need some form of air bubble around him to breathe (please don’t argue with my logic, it’s fragile). Very quickly however I hit technological limits. The combination of the crude stylus, the tiny screen and the poor feedback they both provided (when compared to my trusted Muji 0.38mm blank ink pen and Midori paper notebooks), would mean that I would stop this experiment early on. I count the experiment as a success, because it allowed me to create a new world to get lost in and finally shifted my attention to something different, setting my brain free.</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, my life was transitioning from being a single man, to a fiancé, then husband and finally a father. I was living in the Middle East during this time, which was also going through its own transition as a region, as part of the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring started of as a series of anti-government protests and uprisings that started off in Tunisia and would quickly spread to Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain. Nearly a decade late, the chars of that movement are being felt in Syria which erupted into a civil war shortly after. I felt powerless to stop the strong humanitarian disaster that was unfolding around me, culminating in the image of Alan Kurdi washed up on the shore. An image which still haunts me to this day. My brain would retreat and search for a creative outlet to help me manage through this time.</p>
<hr>
<p>I can’t even remember how or why I would end up calling the entire series <em>Moon Racket!</em>. What I <em>do</em> remember is that the form of logo was crystal clear in my head once I had settled on the name. From this word mark, I originally intended for the series to be filled with onomatopoeia (which is the formation of a word from a sound associated with what is named). I don’t think it happened as often as I would have wanted, but that is certainly something I am looking to lean into more in the future.</p>
<p>Many decisions, that defined the <em>Moon Racket!</em> world would also arrive in a completely organic manner. It felt appropriate that the technology used throughout the series would be locked in the 1980s, while the architecture that was on display would be of the future. Strangely (even to me), the Moon and surrounding planets are characters themselves, complete with eyes, arms and hands.</p>
<p>In developing the the style of art, I went off what I <em>felt</em> looked right, a tactic laced with struggle and self doubt. It took a while to kick my propensity of cross-hatching and tried to create a vernacular that was is my own continues. Having never previously really spent any time developing a dynamic cartoony style of art before, the art would evolve the more I drew. My annoying perfectionism would take a back seat as I kept reminding myself that nobody was paying any attention, so it didn’t really matter. Keep moving. Keep drawing one strip after the other.</p>
<p>Even though he was the basis of the entire series, I struggled a great deal with the design of the Corgan character. In developing the shape of his body I would struggle with shape and form. I would keep adding new elements to his body, but would never feel truly comfortable in his depiction, until recently. By contrast Corgan’s third iteration, which has arrived years after I stopped drawing him in the manner he is presented in the this volume, now practically draws himself and rolls off my pencil.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly the characters and this world, never really took off beyond a limited number of readers. This was expected, considering it would take me over a year to write and draw 20 strips. I didn’t publish nearly enough to build a habit with anyone, but mainly with myself. I ran out of energy, as things in my professional life started to take over and I need to focus a lot more on that side of my life. I decided to put the series on hiatus and capped it creatively, published in March 2017, with a movie poster style image capturing all the characters. The characters would come out of retirement briefly in 2021. I finally was able to fulfil my original vision of creating these on an electronic device. This time it was a 12.9” iPad Pro with an actual stylus (the Apple pencil). After I finally learnt how to draw and colour these characters, I ended up taking an extended break from them.</p>
<p>I could not imagine that these characters would stay with me as long as they have, but maybe that is down to the fact that I have not said all that I wanted to say. The next evolution of the <em>Moon Racket!</em> world is not in the artwork, rather it will be found in the type of topics that I would like to discuss. In defining the direction I want to take these characters in, I am reminded of my mother’s admiration for the political fables presented in <em>Kalīla wa-Dimna</em>, and using it as inspiration for future stories.</p>
<p>For now however, it feels good that the original groundwork for these characters and their world is collected in a single place.</p>

			 <p>Onyx stood at the entrance of the chamber, he could see her a little better. The candles offered some light, but it was dim. Azure was sitting slumped on her throne. She had her hair up in a huge bun on her head, it looked like a bees nest. She looked frail, wrapped herself in a thick cloak.</p>
<p>“Millions flock to this place. They are not here for me. No, they are here for themselves. And yet here you are child, my first visitor in as long as I can remember. Come child. Come closer to we can discuss <em>our</em> future. for mine is linked to yours.”</p>
<p>Onyx moved closer into Azure’s view, “Hello, Azure. It’s me, Onyx.”<br>
“Onyx? Onyx who?”, she said.<br>
Onyx walked closer to her, knelt down and held both her hands together, “Let me remind you.”</p>

			 <p>Onyx was standing in front of an incredibly tall and ornate gate that stretched high into the sky. On either side of the main entrance, the walls were covered in animal statues. Baboons, cats, monkeys, falcons, hippos and lions, all intricately connected with each other.</p>
<p>Onyx followed the flow of the crowd, allowing them to guide him inside. Surprisingly the building looked much larger on the inside than it did on the outside. The main entrance opened up onto a series of halls connected to one another that got larger as they got deeper into the building. Tourists lined every available space in the hall, they bobbed en masse, like waves in the ocean.</p>
<p>He continued with everyone for a little while, moving from hall to the next, deeper and deeper inside he went, until he peeled away into a corridor to the side. The difference in activity between the main halls and this corridor was stark. He was the only person there. He walked alone for a little while coming to a tiny chamber filled with candles, and there at the end sat Azure.</p>

<p>Onyx waded through hundreds, maybe thousands of &lsquo;tourists&rsquo; that walked around aimlessly, gawking at the remains. Giggling. Taking pictures. Some studied remains with intensity. It was a circus. It did however offer a smoke screen that cloaked the main attraction.</p>

Yet within this urban decay, a form of life was flourishing. Millions upon millions of tourists flocking to see and interact with the rubble, paying tribute to what was.</p>
<p>Even among all this chaos, there was no real vantage point anywhere to be found. For that, Onyx had to rely on his eyes in the sky, his <em>Wings</em>.  He tilted his head up, his eyes rolled back and turned a cloudy white. He was no longer on the ground but soaring high above.</p>

			 <p>The hilltop he was sitting on seemed a little less faded than the rest of the expanse around him. There was a tiny hint of colour that was left behind, like the dying embers of a fire. Onyx took the glove of his right hand and pushed his hand into the sand beneath him. He could barely register any activity at all.</p>
<p>He removed his hand from the sand, brought it just before his face, turning it slowly, inspecting it to see if he had missed something. He then dusted his hands against each other. Dust exploded briefly into maroon coloured flecks of life, moving and dancing in the air, before falling back again onto the ground without a trace. Grey and lifeless.</p>

			 <p>Onyx decided to sit down. The terrain was different here as the ground fell gradually away him. He looked across at the <em>Decay</em> that spread itself, seemingly forever. Ashes and rubble from past glories formed a vast sea of grays and whites. The movement from dust clouds made the world around him undulate. For brief moments the dust would clear a little and let him get a better view of his surroundings. This would be swiftly replaced with new dancing dust clouds that would engulf him completely, making it difficult to see very far in front of him.</p>

<p>Had I read it 3 years ago at the peak of <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet</a>, I likely would have moved a lot differently. In hindsight I followed the wrong advice - or at least it didn’t work for me. I don’t feel bad about the work I did (I’m actually <em>very</em> happy with the work itself), but everything around the work? I totally messed up.</p>
<p>I have been waiting to jump back into that particular project when I had the right ideas to move it forward. The reality is that I think I will be there pretty soon. So that’s exciting.</p>

<p>I can’t do it. I can’t bring myself to follow what is unfolding in the Middle East.</p>
<p>I used to harbour hopes that the wider international community might be able to find a way to help mediate things. That’s just not going to happen. The reality is that they have to find a way to live with each other and it has to come from <em>both</em> of them.</p>
<p>The world will watch the coming slaughter, <em>mostly</em> in silence. The response will be unrelenting and extreme. It’s not even a surprise. It’s incredibly harrowing to know what is coming and be helpless to offer any help on an individual level.</p>
<p>It’s not about winning an idealistic cause.<br>
It’s about people.<br>
People, any people, living side by side.<br>
People raising their children.<br>
People taking their kids to school.<br>
People getting married.<br>
People growing up.<br>
People getting older.<br>
People falling in love.</p>

			 <p>Been watching the Beckham documentary. Obviously going for the &lsquo;Last Dance&rsquo; kind of vibes, however the difference for me is I was living in the UK while all of this was happening and so remember watching some of this stuff unfold.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the camera trick the director used of going close up on the interviewee while they are watching and reacting to what they are watching. At first it felt a bit weird, but then you understand the mechanism they are using and you see more.</li>
<li>I can absolutely relate to Beckham&rsquo;s obsessiveness with his cupboard. I don&rsquo;t have anywhere near his stuff, but the limited stuff that I do have shares his setup&hellip;except the angled t-shirts, that was a new, but welcome idea.</li>

			 <h2 id="chapter-03">Chapter 03</h2>
<h3 id="varieties">Varieties</h3>
<p>I’ve increasingly been noticing the varieties that exist in the world around me.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s in the food we eat.</li>
<li>It’s in the clothes we wear.</li>
<li>It’s in the type of dogs we have.</li>
<li>It’s in the cars we drive.</li>
<li>It’s in the phones we use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The variety that is available to us now in 2023 would be mind boggling to many 20 years ago. Yet with that level of choice, we are also confronted with the burden of selection. We have to wade through a mountain of options to find what best suits our own needs.</p>
<p>This is partially why I have been hunting over the last 10 years for <em>sensible defaults</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It is something that I have been very passionate about mainly because it’s one less thing to think about. In the aggregate, when you don’t have to make the same decision again and again means that you are able to spend more time on other things. Life’s low hanging fruit.</p>
<h3 id="the-spice-of-life">The Spice of Life</h3>
<p>Life can be like a massive shopping carts. We fill it with experiences, products, people, memories, food, drink, laughter and sorrow. These items in our carts sometimes are easy to find and sometimes are hidden deep underneath a bunch of other crap we either didn’t need in the first place or that we used and have no need for. And this works across three dimensions. Physical, mind and digital. Managing this cart can either make our lives easier or more difficult. To make things easier we look for sensible defaults. These are knowing traits that address our current, immediate needs. Finding our sensible defaults means that we are not overwhelmed or distracted. Our cart is lighter.</p>
<p>At the start of our journey, our tastes are immature. We’ve not really had the time to sample things to see what we like and what we definitely don’t like. There is a period of exploration that precedes settling on the thing that makes the most sense, most of the time, for the time. Life doesn’t need to be heavily spiced. Equally when it does not have enough spice, it becomes bland. Sensible defaults let you reach a sweet spot of balance.</p>
<p>A sensible default is a the steady state we reach after experimentation. As we grow older, we begin to settle into place. Our go to wine. Our favourite type of slipper. The optimal notebook. Sensible defaults allow us to spend less time feeling cheated by something that is not meant for us.</p>

			 <p>Not sure where he saw this, but on the way to school Zane asked me if he could buy a VR headset. To which I was like, ‘Hell no. Boy, do you even know what a VR headset is?’ His response was surprisingly accurate, although he’s clearly not heard that the Apple VR doesn’t need controllers in your hand…still think it’s a stupid product category.</p>

<p>The best example to this is my 2018 iPad Pro, which still feels magical 5 years after I bought it. I have no intention of upgrading that machine and yet I use it every day.</p>

			 <h1 id="-sunflower-surprises">🌻 Sunflower Surprises</h1>
<p>The blistering sunshine begins to subside.<br>
The days of sweltering heat slowly fade.<br>
Your mornings are now greeted with a sharp pinch of coldness.<br>
A tree here and there has brown leaves that are slowly starting to fall.<br>
The park, just weeks ago lush in shades of green, is now slowly starting to add more movement as leaves begin to fall.<br>
More colours are added to the tapestry.<br>
Your wardrobe begins to shift and change a little.  It’s slowly starting to be hoody season.<br>
You begin to crave different types of food.<br>
Most surprising of all are the sunflowers that have been quietly growing throughout the summer.<br>
Once it’s time they signal the change that is coming by giving one last ray of bright yellow. See you all next year.</p>

			 <p>🍟 My kingdom for a full proof way to make decent oven fries. I know I’ve been doing it wrong, but my fries keep failing. Hunting on YouTube, it seems there are a couple of options that I need to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boil the potatoes for at least 8 minutes. I’ve been blanching them - although have been using vinegar so they don’t break down.</li>
<li>Upgrade to use peanut oil instead of olive oil - because food science. Don’t put a ton, otherwise they will be oily.</li>
<li>Make sure the fries are not crowded fries on a single backing sheet.</li>
<li>Put the fries on the bottom layer of the oven, closest to the heating element.</li>
<li>Flip them 15-20min into the cooking process.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above should hopefully make the fries crispy, but also not oily. I need to crack this, because the kids know I am prone to messing this up regularly. The kids <em>know</em>!</p>

With the exception of my ‘grail’ fountain pen (an Ivory stock Pro Gear), I’ve not really interested in buying new things unless they enhance my stationary life properly.</p>
<p>A couple of boxes of Musgrave’s <a href="https://musgravepencil.com/collections/best-sellers/products/tennessee-red-cedar-pencil">Tennessee Red</a> pencils was top priority and then I also added one additional item which was the <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Staedtler-Pencil-Holder-900-25/dp/B0014R5UXK/ref=asc_df_B0014R5UXK/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=292974100237&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11169445164189141984&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9000945&amp;hvtargid=pla-306556395738&amp;psc=1">Staedtler 900 25</a> pencil holder. It’s everything that I could want as a complement to those pencils. Using my Midori MD Paper A5 notebooks (the only notebook I am using for sketching) and I have my absolute mobile studio with me whenever.</p>
<p>What this has done is that it’s made it easy for me to lean into sketching  <em>Moon Racket!</em> characters, which I am really enjoying.</p>

<li>Large frying pan.</li>
<li>Sharp knife</li>
<li>Two chopping boards (one for veg, one for meat)</li>
<li>Microplane/fine grater (although could just use the knife)</li>

<li>Mixing bowl</li>
<li>Sheet tray</li>
<li>Tongs</li>
<li>Cooking spoon</li>
<li>Spatula</li>

<ol>
<li>Cummin</li>
<li>Paprika (smoked or otherwise)</li>
<li>Oregano</li>
<li>Turmeric</li>
<li>Salt</li>

<p>You can buy all the above from a supermarket for less than the cost of a meal at a restaurant these days. The objective wasn’t to experiment very much with flavours as it was to produce food that was acceptable to everyone. There were some definite hits that I will be doing more often.</p>
<p>To stretch my cooking a little bit, I bought the <em>Men with the Pot</em> cook book. YouTube chefs are some of my favourites to watch and learn from, so I’m really glad to find out about this pair of Polish chefs living in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>This year I am also writing a cook book with my mother, which focuses on the Lebanese cuisine I grew up with. It’s not a massive culinary flex but I know what the gold standard is and keep trying to dial it all in to get those flavours I am very much aware of. I wish I could set her up so she can film everything she does so well, and maybe that’s a project for the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve had the ability to lean into several of my hobbies.
I bought Jame Hoffman’s book <em>How to make the best coffee at home</em>, which is essential reading for anyone making coffee at home. Very well written, the photos throughout remind me of something I usually get when reading <em>The Monocle</em>. It does a great job of educating you and making you get excited about coffee. The only part I am not keen on, is the cover. Great buy and one that I hope to use regularly as I expand my knowledge of this hobby.</p>
<p>I was able to buy a non brand tamper (that I hope works) for my CoffeeJack. Finally got my CoffeeJack this year, tried a couple of times to make coffee without the tamper and lost the will to live and made a right mess of my kitchen. A tamper is an essential part of the kit of making coffee with that contraption. The stand is also pretty important, but will wait until they have their shit together over there before I send them any more money. Also I want to be sure that I like making and drinking coffee this way.</p>
<p>Finally, I got a Timemore Basic Pro scale. This is another major upgrade in my coffee accessories. The gooseneck kettle was pretty key for me and this is another one that just makes life a lot easier. The built in timer is a game changer for me. Yes I know I have a smartphone and a clock on the wall, but honestly this is that much more convenient.</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle for me is a machine grinder, I have my eye on the Varia VS3. This appears to be one of the better small amount grinders out there. Might even go for the white version.</p>
<p>Once I have this, then it’s just paraphernalia  (a cupping spoon here, a funky mug or two there). Still need to see if I want to invest in an espresso machine, but that can wait for a while I think.</p>

			 <p>I’m currently reading ‘Deep Work’ and while I have heard all of this before on Cal Newports podcast, it’s amazing how much I’ve fallen off these very basic elements in my daily working life. The biggest one is the shutdown routine. My journalling habit is non existent at the moment (save this website).</p>
<p>My deep work sessions have also taken a beating. My inbox is a mess. My Calendar is always stacked. I let all of this happen as I focused on very important goals but they came at a huge cost.</p>
<p>I’ve always known what I have to do (and why), I just reverted back to my default which I know better.</p>

			 <p>I am always amazed by the shapes and colours of the clouds here in Florida. They really are unlike anything I have seen in Europe or Canada. They’re defined, fluffy and distinct across an azure blue sky as the backdrop. I love it. It always stands out to me when we visit and I feel that people living here don’t appreciate this aspect of their environment as much - or maybe they’ve just grown accustomed to it all.</p>

<p>It sometimes comes as a comments. It’s sometimes a question. It’s sometimes a bit of both. Either way it’s annoying to me, because I cannot claim to have <em>one</em> home. Home is not where I was raised 30 years ago, or where my parents were raised.</p>
<p>I have had many homes.
Home is where I am at in that moment.
It was Athens. It was Nottingham. It was London. It was Dubai. Until last year it was Copenhagen. It is now Toronto.</p>

			 <p>I lost my uncle Moueen yesterday. My mother broke the news to me and I didn’t understand it at first.  It came as a total surprise. I knew he was struggling with certain health issues, but clearly didn’t realise the extent. Didn’t even cross my mind that this was even on the cards for him. As I understand it, he was sure he’d be out of hospital. Typically when I write these eulogies about my family they are a method of working through the pain. I am usually crying. I am almost always a little distraught.</p>
<p>This time however I am completely numb.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lebanon in the 1980s, the country was at war. It didn’t really matter to my parents. Summers meant we were in Lebanon visiting family. To this day the how remain unknown, but it felt that a new car would be adopted into the wider family every single year.</p>
<p>And so it came to be, that sometime in the late 1980s my father would borrow his uncle Moueen’s gold Pontiac (or some extra long American car) for the summer. This car was entirely out of place in the tiny little town of Saida. It was not designed for roads designed within an old town with its own idiosyncrasies. It stood out, and was so awkward to manoeuvre anywhere. People would get out of their way offering guidance, like Navy Catapult Officers guiding a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier. For the entire summer, my dad relished in the fact that everywhere he went he was referred to as ‘Hakeem’ (hakeem being the Arabic word for doctor.) as he went about his business. For that summer, in the moments he was driving that car and having to interact with people, my dad felt like he was the ‘Hakeem of Saida’.</p>
<p>But of course he wasn’t, he was pretending.</p>
<p>That was his Uncle Moueen’s title. It was a title he built over years with dedication, kindness, compassion, morality and exceptional humanity. Much of this service to the wellbeing and health of helpless children, happened before I was born or when I was a child. My father however was there and he saw what was going on. Each act elevating my dad’s reverence to his uncle further and further.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s relationship with his uncle (like his relationship with any of his uncles) was not <em>traditional</em>. In Moueen, he had the older brother he never had. With that relationship came a profound admiration and reverence, which probably explained his obsession with one of his kids becoming a doctor. For my father, there really was nothing greater that could be achieved than becoming a doctor. A concept that was developed and moulded around one of his real life heros.</p>
<p>My very first recollection of my uncle was on one of his many trips to our house in Athens. My mother had prepared a massive spread (as she would do regularly) in honour of my uncle’s visit. At the end of the meal, I remember asking him how the heart worked.</p>
<p>My mother rolled her eyes. My dad dismissed my request outright. My uncle would proceed to try and educate my 9 year old mind about the inner workings of the heart. I remember nothing of what he said, but sitting on his lap while he talked, made me feel safe.</p>
<p>He occupied a space in my heart that is difficult to express fully, but I will try. Over the years I would meet up with him both in the UK and Lebanon. During the days we would spend together I would get to know him a little better. I would observe his words, which were meticulously chosen. His points were poignantly made. His demeanour, calm and collected. He carried a childlike enthusiasm for all things.</p>
<p>His eyes would widen. His thick bushy eyebrows would become animated. This was always on display when he would show me (or tell me) about his latest woodworking project. While medicine was his vocation, he true love was carpentry. He took exceptional pride in the craft and had dreamed of following in his own father’s footsteps. His father was not supportive of that path for his youngest son. The dedication to woodworking would have to wait until his retirement years.</p>
<p>We would talk about politics and authors. My favourite recommendation of his was <em>Leo the African</em> by Amin Maalouf. To this day, it remains one of my favourite books.</p>
<p>He would talk about history as though he lived through this period himself. Assured of his facts and the reasons behind each element of a story. For me, these conversations were unique in that I would rarely have this breadth with someone else.</p>
<p>I do hold some regret because it was too long since I had reached out to him. I remember the last conversation was a rambling one as I explained my reasons for leaving Denmark and what I hoped to achieve in Canada.</p>
<p>Moving countries and being caught up in everything that goes into settling into a new country. The reality being that I took his presence for granted. Sadly we don’t live forever.</p>
<p>I know that my uncle Moueen was a man that lived with integrity and that his life is to be celebrated. True role models are not common in our world. People in your life that you can look up to and can admire for what they brought to the world. We should all be lucky to have even a fraction of the impact this man, born the youngest of his siblings, would have on the world.</p>
<p>I don’t want to feel sad, because my uncle lived a full life and was able to leave this place better than how he had found it. He made an impact on countless lives. He is a lesson that few will be able to replicate.</p>
<p>Ok, I lied the last sentences have made me cry.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been reading BlogTO for a couple of months now in an attempt to get a high level feel of what’s happening in Toronto. The reporting is generic and base, however it does offer a slice of Toronto, warts and all. This week however I’ve been shocked by the total breakdown in civil behaviour amongst people in Toronto, some as little as 5 minutes from my house. Good natured Canadians exist. They’re just not very common in the cities it seems.</p>

<p><em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, was released on Friday in Japan and is Miyazaki coming out of retirement. Miyazaki is <em>definitely</em> following in the footsteps of another Japanese great, Osamu Tezuka, whose last words were:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m begging you, let me work!</p>

			 <p>Absolutely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl0E-UhKB5E">fascinating video</a> about the cost of lithium mining in both Chile and Bolivia. The last scene with the graveyard of trains really hit home, how places with extreme wealth in natural resources, are always the subject of colonialism and exploitation, leaving little back to help improve the local population. Why is it that some places protect these resources for their people and other places, have never been capable of doing this. Also hadn&rsquo;t heard of direct lithium extraction, so will be diving into that a little bit.</p>

			 <p>When we arrived from Florida, the temperature was starting to turn. Ryan was adamant that he wanted his bike. We tried to reason with him. We tried negotiating. We tried ignoring the subject. In the end the 5 year old won and we got him a small bike, thinking he might not even get to ride it in the winter and he would have outgrown it by the summer - I even kept the box in case we needed to return it.</p>
<p>Turns out it is by far Ryans most prized possession that he did use it a ton in the winter (which was mild I understand) and hasn’t outgrown it completely. Sometimes you have to listen to the five year old.</p>

			 <p>Been thinking really hard about my next phone. I’ve been on the iPhone exclusively since the iPhone 4. The hardware design is now pretty established and somewhat <em>stale</em> - unsurprising since I’ve been using the same form factor for over a decade.</p>
<p>The Sony Xperia 1 V is <em>decidedly</em> a Sony product. It’s sleek. It has character. It has texture (something Apple cannot ever claim). I understand that the software is an improvement on standard Android fair, but will it be too jarring? Will the software have no polish? Is everything else that Sony has to offer enough?</p>
<p>Don’t need to make a decision yet, at least for another few months until the iPhone 15 Pro comes out.</p>

			 <p>Over the last couple of days I have felt a little restless. Recently I&rsquo;ve felt the need to put a little less pressure on myself, when it comes to my creative hobbies. I guess part of this is the realisation that all of these endeavours are a <em>hobby</em>. They all contribute towards a body of work that ultimately helps <em>me</em> get through life; yet they are <em>hobbies</em> nonetheless.</p>
<p>Then I realised how many book projects I have on the go, which likely contributes to that restless feeling. Turns out I have 8 projects in different stages of development. The thing is, a considerable amount of effort goes into the production of any of these book projects. Beyond the writing, illustrating or compiling, putting it all out there takes effort.</p>
<h2 id="kaa-books">KAA Books</h2>
<p>With all of these different book projects that I am working on, I thought it would be good to create a new imprint called <em>KAA Books</em>. I did consider KAA Press or even KAA POW, but books just does what it says on the tin. Still on the fence about whether I always keep the books word in there, or just keep the KAA word mark and call it a day.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2023/img-0429.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>What’s interesting to me is that these are all different forms of work. Comic strips. Children’s book. Cook book. Illustrated novel. I also have a design book (even have the name ready), and a short story collection (have the first 3 written and published).</p>
<p>In writing this, I imagine part of the restlessness has to be the fact that there are all of these projects that I want to get over the line in some way.</p>
<h3 id="1-moon-racket-ambient-hum-vol-1">1. Moon Racket! Ambient Hum Vol. 1.</h3>
<p>I have had to switch to Affinity Publisher, as this image heavy book was really taxing the Pages app, which is better with other kinds of nooks. This will be my next book. The biggest hurdle is the cover, however I now have a clear idea of what I want it to look like.</p>
<h3 id="2-moon-racket-our-solar-system">2. Moon Racket! Our Solar System.</h3>
<p>This is a children’s book idea I have had for a while. what I hadn’t realized was how much I had actually written across 2017. I’m glad I waited a little while as I will need to rework some of this and use the latest character designs which I am really happy with.</p>
<h3 id="3-leilas-kitchen">3. Leila’s Kitchen.</h3>
<p>I started collecting this book earlier this year. It’s a cook book based on my mum’s recipes. The way I see it, we’re co-writing this. I get the receipt, test it out myself and edit according. This is probably a little way off, but I’ll have a ton of fun putting this together and will have something pretty unique and special at the end of it all. This also works really well into the video space, something I’ve not really delved into.</p>
<h3 id="4-moon-racket-season-3">4. Moon Racket! Season 3</h3>
<p>This is something I am writing whenever I get an idea. It’s an outlet that I have missed having, it’s been 10 years since I wrote season two. As I have been rereading the older strips, I’ve found that where I have felt most engaged is when I am commenting on the political landscape .It’s a definite change of course (considering I’ve written a children’s book), but I guess the one thing that is clear with these characters is how they have evolved both in their themes and their design.</p>
<h3 id="5-colours">5. Colours</h3>
<p>Originally conceived as a graphic novel, I’ve now decided to work this as a short story. The main concept gave me incredible brain crack, however I think it works well in the 1500-2500 works/season. There will be at least 4-6 seasons. The final version might be a single book with illustrations but honestly that is years away.</p>
<h2 id="stet">Stet</h2>
<h3 id="1-built-environment-compendium-vol2">1. Built Environment Compendium Vol.2.</h3>
<p>The purple volume. Finally got a print version of this. Will be editing this throughout 2023 and then hopefully Mike can review next year, for publishing summer of 2024.</p>
<h3 id="2-automated-construction">2. Automated Construction.</h3>
<p>The yellow volume. Chapters 1-9 are written, need to stick the landing. This one is proving harder to write because it all has to come together as one volume.</p>
<h3 id="3-built-environment-compendium-vol3">3. Built Environment Compendium Vol.3.</h3>
<p>The orange volume. This is the last full volume that I wrote on Stet. Volume 4 is a way off considering all these other projects that I have going.</p>

			 <p>Somehow we’re at the end of June. Slowly but surely I will have been in Canada for an entire year. It has been an incredible journey. Have I settled into life here? There are certain things that I absolutely love. There are some things that certainly make my eyebrows rise in surprise. No place on Earth is whole. Some places are better suited for you than others. I will say that I feel that I do ‘get’ this place. I understand where a lot of Canadians are coming from.</p>
<p>I do tend to love the colourful characters around the place (not to keen on the crazies that are found downtown…the social fabric should be able to care for these people better, but that is a whole other topic).</p>
<p><em>Every</em> once in a while, I am surprised.  Walking home, on a rainy afternoon, and a dude is walking his dog in an outfit that’s a cross between something from the Village People and a mankini. The confidence to do that is off the charts. Same walk, another dude without a shirt on, is running while hiding from the cars….</p>

			 <p>Spent the afternoon with Ryan pottering around the garage (fixing bikes, recycling for the week, general clean-up), and was transported to my own childhood following my dad as he did his handyman impression (to varying degrees of success). Need to write about one of my favourite tools which has become my pocket knife. Use this thing all the time and really wonder how I managed previously without one.</p>

			 <p>One of the simple pleasures that I was hoping to have when we moved to Toronto was the ability to have some external space. Even though the last few days have had forest fire smoke everywhere, tonight is much better.</p>
<p>There is a slight calm in the air along with a temperature that needs a hoodie and is pretty much perfect.</p>
<p>I am sitting outside on some new garden furniture I have had my eye on for a while now. Finally I get to sit outside, have a beer and chill. I have music playing softly, from a tiny little Mi speaker I bought in Dubai 5 years ago and that is surprisingly great.</p>
<p>In the background I can hear the ambient hum of Toronto streetcars doing their thing.  Every once in a while I hear a dickhead in their car revving their engine.</p>
<p>Summer has arrived.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks back I decided to go ‘cheap’ and got an HDMI switcher and a couple of Amazon basic HDMI cables. The intention was to create a good enough solution for switching my screen between my new Mac and work laptop. Needless to say, it did not go well, and I ended up having to scrap the solution for what I knew was the superior (but pricer) option to begin with (a KVM USB-C switcher).

			 <p>I have to say that the news out of Spain and La Liga around the Vini Jr racism incident, is just so disheartening. The year is 2023, not 1923. The world has got the internet, electrical cars, iPhones and other truly incredible innovations that are meant to move humanity forward. And yet. And yet, here we are that a black man, one of the most exciting players in the game, is treated with absolute human disrespect. It&rsquo;s just not good enough. When this happens, the match <em>has</em> to stop and the fans/team <em>has</em> to be properly punished. It&rsquo;s just simply not acceptable in this day and age to be acting with such ignorance. Total ignorance when there is simply no excuse.</p>

			 <p>Life can be like a massive shopping carts. We fill it with experiences, products, people, memories, food, drink, laughter and sorrow. These items in our carts sometimes are easy to find and sometimes are hidden deep underneath a bunch of other crap we either didn’t need in the first place or that we used and have no need for. And this works across three dimensions. Physical, mind and digital. Managing this cart can either make our lives easier or more difficult. To make things easier we look for sensible defaults. These are knowing traits that address our <em>current</em>, immediate needs. Finding our sensible defaults means that we are not overwhelmed or distracted. Our cart is lighter.</p>
<p>At the start of our journey, our tastes are immature. We’ve not really had the time to sample things to see what we like and what we definitely don’t like. There is a period of exploration that precedes settling on the thing that makes the most sense, most of the time, for the time. Life doesn’t need to be heavily spiced. Equally when it does not have <em>enough</em> spice, it becomes bland. Sensible defaults let you reach a sweet spot of balance.</p>

			 <p>I’ve always, always, <em>look at me</em>, always, had a dislike of the word ‘blog’.
It’s like one extra letter in the word bog.
It&rsquo;s a made up word that doesn&rsquo;t sound very nice.
I appreciate I might be on an island with this, and that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>Rather, I like to think of this site as a catalogue of <em>moments</em> in my life. The more you read all the different definitions the word <em>moment</em> describes, the more apt it feels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An appropriate time for doing something; an opportunity.
A very brief period of time.
Importance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share these moments online.<br>
I share them with the world.<br>
Mostly they go unheeded.<br>
Every once in a while there is some traction.<br>
But mostly they go unnoticed.<br>
And that’s ok.<br>
Thoughts, ideas and interests that captured my imagination.<br>
Even for a few seconds.<br>
A few minutes.<br>
A few moments.</p>

			 <p>It is shocking to me how quickly your body can get used to <em>less</em> food. For years breakfast has been an absolute necessity…but actually it’s not been at all, it’s been a luxury. I thought I would get headaches and not be able to function properly. Not so much. Around 1pm I start to feel the hunger and then I’m good all the way till dinner time. The knock-on is that I don’t feel hungry for the rest of the day either, mainly because my body understands that it’s not going to be getting anything until it’s time.</p>

			 <p>Witnessed the most, un-Canadian thing today. On the intersection in front of our house a man in his early 20s was going absolutely ape-shit. It wasn’t clear to me what the issue was, but I can only imagine he was hit by a car, which drove away. It ruined his bike and the man’s day unravelled from there. Beyond the effing and blinding, he would proceed to pick up his bike and start attacking all the oncoming traffic in a fit of pure rage. I totally felt sorry for him until he started attacking every car that passed by.</p>
<p>Drivers and cars that clearly had nothing to do with his incident, but at that stage, he didn’t care.<br>
His initial rage may have been justified.<br>
He’s subsequent reactions were not.<br>
The whole incident was unfortunate and overall disheartening.</p>

I think proceeded to watch some videos to see what was going on and ordered a replacement. Fast forward a week and the replacement didn’t work properly….and then cmd+c stopped working. So I’ve gone and ordered myself a <a href="https://satechi.net/products/slim-x2-bluetooth-backlit-keyboard">Satechi Slim X2</a> keyboard, that not only is backlit, comes in space grey, but is also cheaper than the current Apple offering - which I really don’t like.</p>

<p>We ended up getting a few books that Zane liked and a poster for me. I would have really loved to spend a little more time walking the floor, but it wasn’t really for the kids (even though the kids section was pretty fun, Ryan was totally bored).</p>

			 <p>Somehow I have ended up putting my dropbox folder of notes on the side and concentrating my efforts on putting everything into the Notes.app. I&rsquo;m following the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA method</a> (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive). The reason for Notes is the fact that I can put photos and pdfs straight into the note itself. Also adding todos and tables is infinitely easier and less cumbersome than plain text. The main disadvantage is that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as <em>mobile</em> as I would like, but if I am actually using the notes and getting all my threads organized, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay.</p>

			 <p>Went to arguably one of the worst stores in Canada, <em>The Beer Store</em>. The logo is awful. It’s a government run entity. It stinks of stale beer. There are usually 5-10 people loitering around there (not really buying anything). Some people are returning bottles and getting cash for them. You don’t go there for the experience.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> reason I go there (occasionally) is for the Esterella Damm that you can only buy in this store. Except this time was different. I got to the front and asked for my Estrella, to my horror, they don&rsquo;t stock it in this branch. Dejected, I started to think about what I could get instead.</p>
<p>I said, &lsquo;What about a strong IPA?&rsquo;
The guy responded, &lsquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking my language.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thus began a little education of Canadian IPAs from someone who loved beer and was super knowledgeable about the subject. Reminded in part of going and hanging around the comic book store with people that loved the medium. The whole interaction took maybe 2 minutes, but I gained a damn good beer and some additional knowledge. Finding those people that can actually help you is such a rarity these days.</p>

			 <p>The last time I went to the cinema was probably seven years ago (I watched <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> in Dubai with my cousin). As I write that I realise that my life has in fact completely changed since I had kids. I remember hearing that life would change, but I just didn’t understand how much.</p>
<p>I think it was seriously fitting to finally see the <em>Super Mario Bros Movie</em> with the kids. This was the perfect introduction to what a cinema experience is about (the large screen, the popcorn) but then we stumbled on Imagine Cinemas in Toronto, which added a very cozy setup and some of the best (reclining) seats I have ever experienced. The staff was amazing, the bathrooms were clean and overall it was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>One of the things that has been a serious improvement on our lives in Denmark is the very fact that we are allowing ourselves to live a little more. Maybe the fact that our kids are a little older. Maybe the fact that there isn’t a global pandemic raging at the moment. I know it’s just the bloody cinema, something that I would typically do multiple times a month, but it’s a start to building out life and enjoying the simple things as well.</p>

			 <p>That was unexpected. My 2021 watch purchase (and my everyday beater watch) is my Vaer field watch. I really love this little watch even though it has had some random time splits over the years.</p>
<p>At the time I bought this watch with two straps. A black rubber strap and a metal strap. Until this week I had never swapped the straps out because I didn’t have the $10 toolkit (sounds insane just writing that down).</p>
<p>With that omission sorted, what I’ve found is that <em>actually</em> I’m not a huge fan of metal straps. Keeps pinching the hairs on my arm. It’s much heavier than the rubber straps, and as my arm contracts and expands throughout the day, it also feels less comfortable.</p>
<p>The issue is that leather straps are water sensitive (and I really have no time for mothering a watch). This means that any future watches will have to get onto a rubber strap. No need for those metal straps I’ve had my eye on for the 2023 purchase.</p>

Originally I had thought that this mode was mainly going to be spent around the creation of comics. Turns out that was <a href="https://kaa.bz/projects">pretty limited conceptually</a>.</p>
<p>The last few years I have tried to combine all my interests together, in all things <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet</a>. While that does remain my focus hobby, I have found that I do want to continue doing other things as well. Making things and putting them out into the world is something that makes me happy. None of these things are commercially viable. I’ll stick to my day job thank you very much.</p>
<p>I do these things very much for myself and if others find value in them as well then that’s an awesome bonus as well.</p>
<p>I do these things because I don’t know how else to be.</p>

			 <p>🏖️ One of the important aspects of a break is the mental reset. It’s the whole reason for the break in the first place. Let your brain wander a little. Let you have some time for things you previously you did not have the mental capacity for. As I’ve grown older I’ve realised how much more important these mental breaks are to let me truck on no matter what is thrown in my general direction.</p>

			 <p>Writing my newsletter on a Sunday can be a pretty relaxed affair. Once I have the idea ready to go, I tend to go into production mode and the few points I want to make come out reasonably quickly. The biggest barrier from stopping me from doing it weekly is that I don’t want to add stress to my life. I like taking it easy with this, because it then becomes sustainable long term.</p>
<p>The part that I am loving is keeping in touch with what is going on in the built world. I get to learn something myself as much as those that have subscribed. This was one of the main reasons to bring the newsletter back even if in a slightly <em>limited</em> capacity.</p>

			 <p>The joys of going into an actual book store is the ability to browse and serendipitously stumble on something gold. In my case it was the works of Will McPhail. I was presented with two options, <em>In</em> and <em>Love and Vermin</em>. Both incredible works of art that I’m so glad to have discovered.</p>
<p>I checked the price on Amazon and obviously it’s like 40% lower…and yet I could have spent my entire life and I would never have stumbled on these books. A fair price of admission.</p>

<p>Since the kids were born I’ve found it  increasingly difficult to sit down and watch a movie the entire way through. In some ways it’s similar to reading a whole novel at the moment. I have several great books on the go and yet haven’t been able to finish any of them.</p>
<p>Maybe this little holiday will recharge some of those muscles and let me actually fill my brain with ideas and creativity that will help my own along the way.</p>

<p>Each channel jostles for attention. Sometimes some channels dominate your thoughts and other times they are left seemingly abandoned. The worst part is when your mind switches constantly between them all. Its true that it is not possible to always be ontop of each of these, all the time.</p>
<p>What I’ve found to be useful is reviewing these every month and seeing where everything is. Has it moved a little since last month? Can you remove some of these from the list. My preferred method of review is pen and paper, in what I refer to as a <em>Life Book</em>. I also have a <em>Work Book</em>.</p>

			 <p>I love comeback stories. A <em>sportsball</em> team rebuilding and improving an existing crop of players. Since the summer I started watching the rebuilding story of the Manchester United team. I honestly thought that it would be something I would follow for a month and then it would fizzle away. Maybe because it was a World Cup year but the story has kept building.</p>
<p>The inspirational part for me is the story of a manager, taking a group of players that had raw talent and making them achieve far more collectively than they could achieve individually. Watching the story unfold every week has been pretty addictive as well, as you get your fix on a regular basis.</p>

<p>If you’ve missed my newsletter In Abeyance, sad news, I’ve decided to stop publishing my thoughts on the built environment in that format. For those wondering if I will do my 1500 word articles, the answer is of course, however they will follow their own schedule and will be released when they are good and ready. In the meantime you can read previous articles here, <a href="https://www.stet.build/articles">www.stet.build/articles</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that I’ve started another newsletter, Stet. Stet will share one single idea about the built environment and will be published every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The very second article written for the old In Abeyance newsletter was centred around photovoltaics - it’s therefore fitting that Stet starts life on the same topic.</p>
<p>Read the first issue of Stet, <a href="https://stet.substack.com/p/001">Photovoltaic Carrots &amp; Sticks</a>. If you’re not already subscribed, now is a good time to remedy that monsterous error in your email diet.</p>

			 <p>What’s great about Status.lol is that it ‘gets’ it. It’s not a ‘blogging’ platform rather it’s a place to post live items, things that you don’t want your main website to get clogged up with randomness that is not going to really matter (or possibly incoherent) in the future.</p>
<p>It’s a place for the now. You want to share your thought so that it’s outside your head. The emojis add a great level delightfulness. The cherry on top is being able to add the latest status to your site with a small bit of JS that you can customise as well. Love it.</p>

			 <p>I am soo done with Kickstarter.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe isn’t the wait. It’s poor communication from the project makers. For years I have been getting one direction communication with the <a href="https://www.coffeejack.co.uk">CoffeeJack</a> creators. They inundate my inbox with emails about progress (or lack of it), delays, additional costs - all of which is fine.</p>
<p>What is not fine is the fact that I want confirmation of something, send an email months and months ago and no response. I follow up a few times. Crickets. They basically don’t respond to email.</p>

			 <p>It did pain me to do it but I moved my <em>In Abeyance</em> newsletter over to Substack from Buttondown. My main reason for the move is the constant spam that I was getting and having to manage.</p>
<p>I get the value of something like Substack now.</p>
<p>They have also managed to add some pretty nice features to the newsletter itself. Having the ability to start a discussion thread with everyone subscribed (and that is connected to the app) is an awesome feature. It’s a discussion thread and newsletter manager all wrapped into one.</p>

<p>This one is a little late but there is a story there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I knew I needed to have something ready to go for this year. A way to track my No-S Diet and also how often I worked on all things Stet.Build. The aim being to rebuild habits that I developed several years ago and that have no fallen away from me because relocating your life to a whole new country is major disruption.</p>
<p>I did most of the design work, but then lost steam when I bought a bunch of calendars from Muji. My thought process was that I won’t need this particular calendar anymore. The Muji ones were more than enough. And yet I found out that they were not enough. They allow me to see the month, but this Actions Calendar gives me so much more information and appreciation of my goals across 12 months.</p>
<p>Available in 2 printer friendly configurations. The Letter edition (for all the North Americans) and the A4 edition (for the rest of the world?). I’ve included a small ‘manual’ in there to describe the design decisions behind the calendar.</p>
<p>I’m also using Gumroad to distribute all things digital come from the site.</p>

			 <p>📷 I stumbled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGZMTeKSsTs">this video</a> that was talking about trying to come up with a cheaper version of an every day camera. I’ve been on the hunt for something like this for a while. My original thinking has been that it should be a brand new camera body…but actually I was thinking about this in the wrong way. See my issue was a question of form factor.</p>
<p>While my Sony NEX-6 camera is ok (no Wi-Fi and a decade old sensor), I had some decent lenses but they are big. That bulk ultimately meant that I haven’t used the camera as much as I would have liked. So I decided to buy a cheap-ish pancake lens and see if this develops into a habit</p>

			 <h1 id="planning--recording">Planning &amp; Recording</h1>
<p>This winter break has been about letting my mind wander around. For the majority of 2022, it has been working on overdrive. My energy levels were mostly depleted and I was just mentally tired. It take a good week for a lot of the residue to leave your mind and for you to begin letting ideas and thoughts back in.</p>
<p>In order to quiet down a number of voices in my head I was able to write my hopes and aspirations for some of my key areas of interest. Some are physical items, some are trying to learn new skills. Part of the reason for being so specific is to focus the mind from distraction as the year goes on. The other part is to strike things off as I go forward as a reminder of what was achieved.</p>

			 <p>Falling out of habits is very easy. Falling back into the habit is harder.</p>
<ol>
<li>Micro habits are the start of establishing <em>macro</em> habits.</li>
<li>Stacking these habits is an important trick to use at the start.</li>
<li>Making habits discoverable to carry out the habit is the last piece of the domino.</li>
<li>Establishing a time and a place.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="journaling-and-writing">Journaling and Writing</h2>
<p>This is an important way of settling my mind.  In 2022 I fell out of the habit, jumping back sporadically. So I’ve decided to stack, time and place. Stack the habit when I make my coffee in the morning and tea in the evening. My journal and pen are located in my kitchen drawer.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I completely fell off the wagon. Part of this is the habit, but equally part of this was having a stack of books that I could jump into. I made a list of books that I have bought that I would like to get stuck into at some point this year. 9 -12 I own and about 3 would be new.</p>
<p>Kindle is now located next to my bed. The aim is to read for 30 minutes a day.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>Writing for Stet.Build every day is the other activity that settles my mind. This break I was able to map out Season 5 of <em>In Abeyance</em> while also looking to starting work on volume 2 of the <em>Built Environment Compendium</em>.</p>
<p>The writing will be a daily morning activity, with the achievable aim of writing 100 words. This is the most productive hour of my day.</p>
<h2 id="designing">Designing</h2>
<p>I’ve found that what little energy I have in the evenings has generally been squandered on aimless internet-ing and the occasional show. The one activity that I have been able to carry out (on those occasions where I could yank myself away from the internet), has been designing. Books. Websites. Whatever.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This year I have been preparing myself for the coming year by writing about <em>all</em> the things. Turns out I have around 14 different channels in my life (outside work). This all contributes to much clutter of the mind. Each channel asks for a certain amount of time and space in my mind.</p>
<p>I have only found one way to being able to quiet the sound, which is by writing about each of the channels and letting my mind wonder around in this channel. One of the unexpected benefits of this approach is that the brain starts to make connections previously that had not been previously made.</p>

			 <p>Around the time that Zane was born Google released an ad for Gmail called ‘<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zhPklt9nYas">Dear Sophie</a>’. It was fun and sweet and seemingly celebrated the internet. At the time I felt this was a great idea but didn’t want to use Gmail for this.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and I’m using my site to capture my thoughts. I began posting some stuff about the kids online but it felt like I was doing something <em>wrong</em>. They had no say in the matter.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few more years beyond that and I’ve finally worked out a way to create my own version of ‘Dear Sophie’. I’ve created separate journals for each of the boys and have begun writing small text messages and adding photos to each of them.</p>
<p>My site is written for my future online reading self. These journals are written for my boys after they’ve grown up and can understand what it took to raise them and what my hopes and thoughts for them were. I can’t wait to fill each journal.</p>
<h2 id="tricking-my-brain">Tricking My Brain</h2>
<p>The final piece of all of this was using muscle memory of writing to my site, I use Drafts. Add <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CR">this action</a>, and modify the url with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dayone://post?entry=[[draft]]&amp;journal=Name_of_Journal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also gone and tweaked the appearance so that it is distinct from my Micro.blog action list.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been using <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> as my default web site hosting for this site for just under 5 years. I’ve written about the why widely - across the five years, it’s functionality has grown way beyond its initial offering. As far as <em>publishing</em> short thoughts on the web, I honestly feel that it has no parallel.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing or editing said posts however, it is feels to me like there is a very clear hole for an app to exist.</p>
<p>This app would need to sync all of your existing posts and photos. You could then switch between posts quickly manage and edit them without the need for a (clunky) web interface - ideally without having to tap edit, just get in there and edit away. There appears to be a new versioning system baked in Micro.blog, this functionality (if available) could be made to allow you to see the differences between the proposed and the existing post.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the technical limitations of such an app is? Would Micro.blog even allow multiple edits to be uploaded at the same time? I guess I am looking for a MarsEdit on iOS or an equivalent to reduce the friction to managing and editing as much as possible.</p>

			 <p>I sent out my last newsletter around the time I was starting to make an exit from Denmark. It was the right time to pause my writing activities as I really didn’t need any more pressure than I already had. Fast forward 6 months and we’re now slowly edging towards a modicum of calmness. There is a seeming rhythm to life again. Mentally my brain is not fried anymore and I have begun getting the itch to research, write and draw.</p>
<p>I miss the research, writing, surprise and excitement about all things related to the built environment. What I don’t miss is the stress every month of trying to pull together an article. I do this for myself and those who are interested in how I write about a specific topic. Writing for the new season starts soon.</p>

<p>My best year was back in 2016 (average of 6000 steps/day), it drops significantly from there and has hovered around the 5000 steps/day for several years now. This year shows a slight uptick of 5200 steps/day.</p>

<p>Getting a replacement wasn’t simple, as many covers on Amazon claim they’re not compatible (not sure if that’s just the camera bump issue, or also the buttons). It does have one shortcoming and that’s the fact that when it is folded on itself, the flap doesn’t attach securely to the back of the iPad - for the price however, can’t complain.</p>

			 <h1 id="the-year-of-less">The Year of Less</h1>
<p>I’ve been meandering for the last month or so thinking about my theme for 2023 will be. 2022 was the Year of Momentum. In many, many respects that’s exactly what it was, but it was also hit by the <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/tsod/">Summer of Disruption</a> which derailed the later half of the year completely. Then this morning I realised that there was only one way to go in 2023, the Year of Less.</p>
<p>Why the Year of Less?<br>
Because I want less disruption.<br>
Less stuff.<br>
Less food.<br>
Less stress.<br>
Less negative thoughts.<br>
Less tiredness.<br>
Less distraction.<br>
Less drama.</p>
<p>Ultimately <em>less of certain things</em> means more of something else - the void has to be filled.</p>

<ol>
<li>Calendar ‘Bubblegum’ 2023 (kaa/002)</li>
<li>Typeface 01 (kaa/003)</li>
<li>Goodnotes Templates (kaa/004)</li>
<li><em>Moon Racket!</em> Collection. Will need a new cover. I might also add a few new one page ‘stories’. (kaa/005)</li>
</ol>
<p>I also fully intend to write a short story in November as well and I would like to finish off the short story I started last year as well (but maybe I get to that this year).</p>
<h2 id="stet">Stet</h2>
<p>Beyond that there will be three Stet.Build projects that I would like to tackle:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>BEC Vol.2</em> - The Purple Edition. This will need a new cover, a ton of editing and pulling the document together in pages. (SB/002).</li>
<li><em>Automated Construction</em>. Complete the draft, currently sitting at 75% complete. (SB/003).</li>
<li>Season Four of <em>In Abeyance</em>. Six issues published bi-weekly.</li>

			 <p><strong>30 / The Summer of Disruption</strong><br>
It was a summer like no other. One we would never forget, for all the wrong reasons. Although our family had been separated multiple times, that was not the hardest part. The hardest part was the uncertainty that put every decision we made under great pressure.</p>
<p>We had moved to Canada from Denmark, ironically it is the Danish government that aptly calls this process ‘Family Reunification’. After four seemingly endless months, the family was finally together again.</p>
<p>I opened the front door of the house, just as Yasmine’s taxi was arriving. The kids excitement was palpable. They hurried out the door, ‘Mommy!’</p>

I woke up early on the Tuesday. Quickly checked the news to see where Hurricane Ian was at? The airport released a statement that they were shutting down and cancelling all flights after 16:30. Yasmine’s flight was due for take off at 12:30.</p>
<p>4 hours.</p>
<p>After waiting four months, four hours was all that separated her from being stranded even longer. What if the flight was delayed? What if the airline decided not to fly that day? Four hours was our window of error.</p>
<p>I took a deep breathe.</p>
<p>I could only think of the ending of the movie ‘Argo’. Her plane took off. She had finally made it out and was en route to Toronto.</p>

Yasmine woke me up around midnight. ‘Quickly, get onto the website, two tickets have appeared for a Tuesday flight out of Tampa to Toronto. Book one before they go!’</p>
<p>I groggily opened my computer and tried to buy the ticket. My credit card was maxed out. No time to top up funds. I pulled my other credit card and tried again. It went through. We had a ticket out of Tampa.</p>
<p>The next bit of good news came the next morning with the triumphant return of her passport.</p>
<p>Now we just needed a hurricane to behave itself.</p>

			 <p><em>The Summer of Disruption</em> has been both the easiest thing that I have written and the hardest. When I landed on my couch in October 2022, I reflected on the past few months and how unnecessarily <em>intense</em> it had been.</p>
<p>Our best laid plans had evaporated and we kept coming up against obstacles. It felt like a story I had to preserve for my kids to learn and understand that life is not an easy journey and will throw seemingly insurmountable challenges. In your darkest moments (and there were plenty this summer), remember to keep moving forward. Fighting for a better future is one of the most human attributes anyone can have.</p>
<hr>
<p>In writing these short stories, the process of writing them has always been a joy to me. I write these in the evening just before going to bed. This one was a little different in that I wrote the first 10 instalments in one sitting and the last 5 instalments also in one sitting. I knew which beats I had to hit, but how deep I would go into any one aspect was left for the day itself.</p>
<p>One idea that I have is to develop this story into a visual story - a graphic novella. Maybe something for next year, along with a <em>Moon Racket</em> collection as well.</p>
<p>For now there are three instalments left. Hopefully I stick the landing.</p>

			 <p><strong>27 / The Summer of Disruption</strong><br>
The rest of the weekend felt like an eternity. We started looking at flights out of Tampa that flew to other states first, with onward flights to Canada. Maybe she could drive out of the state and take a flight from there? What about her family. Would they be ok to stay?</p>
<p>‘Do you think I’ll get my passport tomorrow? Do you think I’ll be able to fly out?’</p>
<p>All summer long I had tried to put on a brave and positive face. That things would all work out in the end.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know Yasmine. I really don’t know.’</p>
<p>Considering the summer we had just been through this latest obstacle felt…absurd.</p>

			 <p><strong>26 / The Summer of Disruption</strong><br>
The news about Hurricane Ian began making the rounds on Thursday. For my entire life, hurricanes were things that happened in far off American lands. Now it was about to happen to us. A one in a hundred year hurricane was heading towards Tampa, a city Yasmine had called home for 3 months.</p>
<p>We got word that Yasmine’s passport was on its way. The <em>earliest</em> it would likely arrive was on Monday. Saturday morning we sat on the decision to buy a ticket for Tuesday, by Saturday afternoon all the flights out of Tampa (to Toronto) were sold out.</p>
<p>Even if she got her passport in time, was she going to make it out? So the weekend of panic began.</p>

We had to fill in a bunch of forms and pay for a sticker to be put in a passport&hellip;except there was two kind of payments needed. The first was an online payment, relevant to a 2022 post-pandemic world, while thd other was an American construct I was familiar with because of adverts for miracle cures or get rich schemes in the back of comics I used to read as a teen called a <em>postal money order</em>.</p>
<p>We missed the money order and there was no other way to get them $12. We had delayed the process by three days. Considering the wait and pressure we had just been through, 3 additional days felt like a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>Except it wasn’t. We would be tested again by something brewing off the coast of Cuba.</p>

As the weekend approached we were edging closer and closer to very difficult decisions. This arrangement was not a long term solution. Maybe we had to go back to Denmark and wait it out? Maybe we could start the immigration process to the US? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.</p>
<p>The news we had been waiting for all summer came on a Friday.  I got a text message from Yasmine.</p>

			 <p><strong>23 / The Summer of Disruption</strong><br>
I took time off and tried to enjoy Toronto with the kids. We went to parks, bookstores, the Royal Ontario Museum. I took them on the Streetcar and the subway. I took them to a city farm. We went to the mall - an activity that now felt like a real novelty as we had not done this throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>That entire summer I felt like Charlie Brown. Every time I was close to kicking the ball, Lucy (or the IRCC),  kept yanking the ball away from me.</p>
<p>40 days became 50 days.<br>
I am Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>Days passed and we heard nothing back. Our lawyers sent messages to their counterparts and our member of parliament&hellip;and we got nothing back. Yasmine&rsquo;s application was in progress.</p>
<p>50 days became 60 days.<br>
I am Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>Monday came and with it a glimmer of hope. We were now over the number of days the website advised. We should hear back any minute now.</p>
<p>60 days became 65 days.<br>
I am Charlie Brown?</p>

Yasmine&rsquo;s frustration with her situation was amplified further when we realised that from the entire family, she had the biggest claim to entering Canada freely. Turns out her grandfather on her mother&rsquo;s side was Canadian.</p>
<p>Immigration laws in North America leave a lot to be desired, but in essence, you are not guaranteed citizenship even from parent or grandparent. There are windows that you can trigger things. If you fall outside those windows there is no recourse.</p>
<p>For Yasmine, her claim to Canadian citizenship appears to have completely disappeared in 2009 when the laws were changed.</p>

The family had fully boarded an emotional rollercoaster. I gathered the kids and our suitcases ready to go to the airport. Our Uber rolled up to our rented apartment in Florida and we said our long goodbyes.</p>
<p>As we left, Zane, who is by far the more sensitive one, burst out into tears about saying goodbye to his mother. Probably not since he was born had my tears flowed as hard. I tried to hide them but I couldn&rsquo;t hold back the emotion of having to separate the kids from their mother. I reassured him that this would be for a short while and that his mother would join us shortly.</p>
<p>In that moment I knew that this was all just wishful thinking and I was not in control of my family&rsquo;s future. A faceless government entity was.</p>

I was’t sure how to approach the subject with Yasmine. When her aunt passed away, I had stayed with Zane, while Yasmine and Ryan flew back. This was a decidedly different affair. I was going with intent of bring back both kids with me.</p>
<p>I knew she would find the whole situation unacceptable.<br>
I knew she would fight it with every fibre of her being.<br>
I knew it would break her.<br>
I also knew that we had little option.</p>
<p>The most we could do is ring fence the amount of time we would let this situation drag on for. We settled on two weeks.</p>

As September started and it was clear that the kids were not going to be starting school with all the other kids. There was a sense of both urgency and resignation jostling for attention and supremacy in equal measure.</p>
<p>Before worrying about Yasmine&rsquo;s ability to enter one country, we had to turn our attention about over staying our welcome in another. The kids were on a different visa to their mother and their welcome was shortly running out.</p>

After a couple of weeks I really began to miss my family. A good sign for sure, but there was a considerable mental weight to carry. I wanted to see and experience the city with my family, not on my own.</p>
<p>Another Monday rolled around and the processing time jumped from 30 to 40 days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been in this situation before&rsquo;, I would tell myself. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll resolve itself in a couple of weeks&rsquo;, I would reassure myself.</p>
<p>But I was just lying to myself. The reality was that we were far from being &lsquo;resolved&rsquo; and we would face several twists and turns before this was over.</p>

			 <p>The world will be fine without Twitter. In fact I would say that the world will be better off in general if it burned to the ground and people used that energy on something <em>better</em>.</p>
<p>I do feel bad for those that clearly want to express themselves on the internet and have defaulted to what is provided to them by the big tech companies.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to look for the alternatives. There are many. Some with a greater network effect than others. You&rsquo;ll find people to interact with. That number will grow over time. There is no real hacking the system. If you talk or write about something in an interesting manner or that provides value then others will find you. If they don&rsquo;t, then at least you have at the very least addressed your itch to express yourself on the internet.</p>
<p>Hopefully though people will realize however that the stream they have been posting to Twitter is of little value beyond the <em>moment</em>. The best way to see if that is the case is to have a look at your archive.</p>
<p><em>Maybe</em> (and I would say that this is the rule and that there are outlier exceptions) you didn&rsquo;t create anything of value there.</p>
<p><em>Maybe</em> your best thoughts lie ahead of you.</p>
<p>Let it burn to the ground and then move somewhere else and build something that gives something back to you.</p>

It&rsquo;s around this time that I began looking more closely at the IRCC website (the IRCC being the &lsquo;Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada governmental agency).</p>
<p>The website would get updated every Monday with an estimate of how long you <em>could</em> wait to hear back from them on your case. The countdown began from when they received all your information and biometrics.</p>
<p>When we started this process we were looking at 15 days. That number had now jumped to 30 days. That meant that Yasmine and the kids only needed to be in the AirBnB for a couple of weeks. I took a deep breathe, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not so bad&rsquo; I told myself.</p>
<p>The canary could now sense that something was <em>definitely</em> not right.</p>

I don’t remember when the panic started. Was it at midnight? Was it first thing in the morning? Regardless of when it started but there was an incident at my brother-in-laws house.</p>
<p>Seems the washing machine started spewing water out of the front door and flooded the top level. This may have caused an electrical spark. The fire brigade was called in. The kids were yanked out of their beds. There was a scramble to get the family into an AirBnB while emergency work with blowers was carried out. An already downbeat situation got worse</p>
<p>Its around this time that we all started wondering, ‘What else could possibly go wrong?’</p>

			 <p><strong>15 / The Summer of Disruption</strong><br>
Unlike in Copenhagen, the summer in Toronto was hot and humid but not unbearable (that description id reserved for Gulf summers). The best way to experience a city is not by car, rather it is by foot. The architecture around me was inviting and warm. There were porches and chairs. Many of the houses and buildings were old. Not in a European 100s of years old, but in a North American, wooden facades that have faded and weathered slowly with the passing of the years and haven’t really been maintained.</p>
<p>First things first,  breakfast. My first day in Toronto began at a breakfast spot in ‘Little Italy’ - it was the only place open on an early Sunday morning. As I quietly ate my eggs I was reminded of when we moved to Copenhagen three years earlier when again we ran into visa issues. That was resolved pretty quickly though, so hopefully this would be the same.</p>

The world is vast and we have developed seemingly countless ways to do practically the same thing. Build houses. Buy and sell goods. Raise children. Go to school. Heal ourselves. Live life. Yet each city and country goes about things in a different way.</p>
<p>The feel of discovering a new city is one of the few magical moments that one can manufacture. I highly recommend that everyone challenges themselves to experience this at least a few times in their lives. While I have travelled this journey more than most in the last few years, the magic of discovery was strong in Toronto. The city offered a cornucopia of discovery.</p>

As the summer continued, I felt that I was ready to go back to work. Yasmine and the kids would have to stay back in Florida, hopefully wait a little bit longer for the visa to arrive.</p>
<p>The narrative I told myself was that this was a <em>good</em> thing. That this would allow me to settle into Toronto, get my bearings and get things ready for the family before their arrival. Even though it was a forced decision, it wasn’t a terrible situation. Yet.</p>

Sadly the world continues to create a shared reality for millions across the world. The reality of being born to a war torn country. Lebanese. Vietnamese. Afghani. Iraqi. Syrian. Yemeni. Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Those from any of these places know and understand that war not only tears buildings and places apart but also the very fabric of society. It takes decades to grow back and when it comes back, it is never the same. It will never reach what it could have been.</p>
<p>A mad, deranged, decrepit moth flapped it’s wings in Moscow, which sent shockwaves smashing first through Ukraine before continued further afield.</p>
<p>Few were immune from this single moth’s effect. For some the impact was an upended life. A life as a refugee. A generation of displaced immigrants. For others it was as fundamental as the bread they eat being taken away.</p>
<p>For our family, the ramification was that all visas to Canada ground to a halt. Processing times were effectively fabrications heading in the wrong direction.</p>

Several months earlier Vladimir Putin’s mental health completely disintegrated and he launched his attack on Ukraine. A war that remains completely senseless except in the mind of a madman with an acute Napoleon complex.</p>
<p>History will <em>rightly</em> not be kind to Putin. This disastrous situation importantly highlights just how dangerous mental health is to the stability and prosperity of the world. With this move comes a considerable amount of collateral destruction. Not just to the lives of those inside Ukraine but to all those around the perimeter. Countless were caught out because of this one person. A worse example for a human being you would be hard pressed to find.</p>

The family had a period of relative calm after the chaos of these few weeks. We were able to enjoy the Florida weather. It would be reasonably hot in the morning where I would take the kids on walks and to the community centre pool. By around 5pm the clouds would form and some crazy torrential rains would come down. Even though it rained every day without fail, overall we would wake up to glorious sunshine which we had been mostly deprived of in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>It was a fitting mental respite. The calm before the storm. While the start of the summer was emotionally difficult a second wave of emotional difficulty was heading our way. We were just blissfully unaware of its approach.</p>

Our journey with Canada’s immigration authority would begin at the end of June. This saga would totally disrupt our lives for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>They needed Yasmines biometrics. Fine. The Canadian embassy is a stones throw from the office in downtown Copenhagen. <em>Except</em> this facility was not available in Denmark. The job of a $50 finger scanner and a web camera was beyond the means of one of the most advanced countries in Europe. Our only option was to get the biometrics in a completely different country.</p>
<p>This was the canary in the coal mine taking its first few good breathes of carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>We linked this action with our trip to Florida. At the start of the summer the service was readily available. 2 weeks later we had to wait 3 weeks for what would turn out to be a 5 minute interaction.</p>
<p>The canary took a few more deep breaths.</p>

			 <p>Because of strikes across Ontario, schools were closed yesterday. The school supplied us with Chromebooks in case remote learning became a thing (thankfully it didn’t), but it allowed me to take a look at one of these things for the first time. Got an HP machine which was exactly what you want it to be. Compact. Rugged. Well built. Classy Chrome logo in the corner.  Don’t know what I would use it for but really liked it.</p>

It started off with a dull pain at night. By morning it had become sharp. Maybe some tea will help? Maybe its nerves? By noon on a Sunday it was clear she had to see someone. <em>Something</em> just wasn’t right.</p>
<p>Since moving back to America Sharron had never needed to see a doctor, that wasn’t scheduled weeks in advance. The walk-in clinic quickly said to head to the hospital. The hospital quickly confirmed she had a burst appendix and needed an operation.</p>
<p>For days Sharron would say that she had no more tears left. When does an eighty year old suffer from a burst appendix? Sorrow and sadness can get trapped inside but eventually it all finds a way out.</p>

The mood at the house was understandably sobering and reflective. Death is hard on those left behind, except when you’re a kid. Kids understand that something has changed but they have a slightly different attitude on this loss as memories are still being developed.</p>
<p>The last video that Jamal had sent us was a tour of the community and what he wanted the kids to experience. In a kind of remembrance every morning we would go to the community pool.</p>
<p>The kids brought an energy with their innocence. They didn’t know any better. And that attitude helped us all move a little forward.</p>
<p>All except Sharron. How does a mother who just lost her first born deal with the loss? Her pain would manifest itself in a completely different way. One that none of us could have predicted or expected.</p>

			 <p><strong>06 / The Summer of Disruption</strong><br>
All we needed was one hotel room for the family to sleep in before heading to the airport at 6am in the morning. Simple right? Except it wasn’t. Try as much as I did, I could not find a single available hotel room anywhere in Copenhagen. You had to travel 3 hours out to find an available room.</p>
<p>Something really strange was going on.</p>
<p>I started to vent to Mindy and as usually she was able to offer some clarity on what was happening in the country. The European dentist convention was being held in Copenhagen that week and every single available hotel room was fully booked.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of that scene in <em>The Croods</em> where the father pulls his entire family over him like a blanket. Needs must.  We would <em>not</em> be taking our mattress topper or our pillows with us. The whole family would ‘rough it out’ for the night before waving goodbye to our life in Denmark.</p>

12 days.<br>
Our original plan was to go to Greece for 10 days, see my parents, come back to Denmark, pack our house before flying out to Jamal’s in 12 days time. We missed him by 12 days.</p>
<p>Our plans shifted and changed to suit the new reality we found ourselves in. The first step was to make our exit from Copenhagen. We organised the earliest slot available with the movers and then tried to book a hotel for the night before flying out of the country and heading to Tampa.</p>
<p>The dentists of Europe had other ideas.</p>

15 minutes ago.<br>
We were in a rush to get out the door. To get into a taxi. To get to the airport. To get through security. To get onto a plane. To get to Athens. To get to the hotel. To see their grandparents. To see the boys jump into the ocean for the first time in their recent memories.</p>
<p>15 minutes later.<br>
Time instantly became irrelevant. We no longer had anywhere to go, at least not in the immediate future. We never made it out of the house. Yasmine was inconsolable. Jamal wasn&rsquo;t in the best of health, but the timing was unexpected.</p>
<p>Except maybe in hindsight it wasn&rsquo;t. The signs were all there, we just chose to ignore them.</p>

5:26am.<br>
There are moments in your life that take you completely by surprise. They instantly knock the wind out of you. They tighten your chest. The wounds they inflict however are not physical. They are wounds to your mind.</p>
<p>Your mind does not know <em>how</em>. How to respond. How to react. How to make it stop. How to make your very reality different.</p>
<p>For Yasmine, one of these moments was when she was told that her oldest her brother had died.</p>

5:25am.
The phone rings. It&rsquo;s Sharron. I pick it up half asleep as I am sorting through the final pieces of the suitcases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Sharron. Gonna quickly pass you onto Yasmine. In the middle of last minute packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t let her get any words in as I quickly pass the phone over the Yasmine, her voice is weaker than usual. I gestured to Yasmine to keep it brief so that we could make it out of the house by 6am to reach the airport in time.</p>

Wake up. Groggy.
We were up till past midnight sorting our suitcases. The preparation chaos is both expected and welcome. We&rsquo;ve not had to do this for a while. Our first family holiday in over three years. Regardless of how tired we are in the moment, our excitement, for what&rsquo;s to come, is palpable.</p>
<p>Sun. Beach. Food. Family.</p>
<p>Before we could do any of that, we first had to get out of the house.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I heard an <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5UIWACrA4i0">Obama speech</a>. Nothing this man does has a direct impact on my life (maybe tangentially now that I live in Canada?). And yet I continue to listen to him. To be inspired by his words. Not because I believe in &lsquo;America&rsquo;. America does its own thing and doesn&rsquo;t care for me.</p>
<p>Rather Obama occupies a group of politicians that I look up to from around the world. People trying to make things better. There are many. Jacinda Arden. Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Mario Draghi. Nelson Mandela. Rafik El Hariri. Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>We should remember them and celebrate them. They don&rsquo;t last forever.</p>

			 <p>Today was the first day of Canadian school for Zane. He’s been outside the school environment for a while now and even then, Danish school did not go onto 3:30pm, so the little guy got tired. He’ll adapt pretty quickly I’m sure.</p>
<p>My favourite moment however was when he saw his brother and gave him a massive hug and wouldn’t let him go. Over the last few years the boys have seen a lot of each other and have developed really strong bonds. While they each have their own interests they share an intersection of being each others best friend.</p>

I know we have donated our fair share of toys to playgrounds, but this is definitely one of those things that parents should consider as the next place for unused toys. Other kids will get a ton of use from these items that your own child has moved on from.</p>

			 <p>It started off with Jamal’s death. Our holiday to Greece was cancelled. As a result I have not seen my parents since the summer of 2019, when we left Dubai and moved to Denmark.
A week later we were in Tampa. A city neither myself or Yasmine had ever heard of. In fact, the only reason I had even heard of Tampa was because of <em>Crossgen</em> comics.
There was a period of mourning and sadness and uncertainty in the house. I tried to keep it hidden from the boys and let them enjoy the summer. 2 weeks in, my mother-in-law’s appendix burst - caused by the pain from loosing her son.</p>
<h2 id="ircc-fiasco">IRCC Fiasco</h2>
<p>There is no better way to say this other than the IRCC shat the bed over the summer. Our waiting times went from 1 week to 23 days, to 35 to 45 to 55 to 66 and we finally got the ok at day 73!
To not fall foul of any visa issues, I flew out to the US and brought the kids over without their mother. That was a tough decision predicated on a complete leap of faith. The kids would only be separated from their mother for a few weeks maximum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were ready for Canada. Sadly, Canada was not ready for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest irony in all of this? Of everyone in our family, morally Yasmine has the biggest claim to entering and staying in Canada. Turns out her grandfather was Canadian. Two generations later his granddaughter has to jump through hoops to re-enter. The world we have created has so many fucked up rules.</p>
<h2 id="hurricane-ian">Hurricane Ian</h2>
<p>I am reminded of the final scene from Argo (spoiler alert if you’ve not watched it, you really should). My wife left Tampa 4 hours before they shut down the airport. She was in Tampa for over 3 months and escaped a 1 in 100 year hurricane by 4 hours.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-start">A New Start</h2>
<p>It is completely surreal experience for my entire family to be here in Canada with me.
We have a lot of living to get done.</p>

			 <p>On our way back home tonight, Zane noticed a man sleeping on the floor. His first thought was to ask if he was ok. Thus began an awkward conversation about homelessness. Being a child born in the gulf and raised in Copenhagen, this type of thing isn’t something he has ever encountered before.</p>
<p>The truth is that I don’t know enough about the situation here in Canada. Why is it prevalent? Are there any government plans and how robust are they.</p>
<p>We both agreed that it was incredibly sad and Zane’s parting words on this was that he wanted to help this man and that he should fight for his life.</p>

			 <p>🇨🇦 It’s been an incredibly difficult start to life in Canada. Difficult is a mild way to put it considering that the family has still not arrived here in Canada. The problem? A back log of visas that runs all the way back to several months ago. At first it was inconvenient but manageable. Now it’s starting to have much wider impacts. For a start the kids will not be able to enjoy the first days of school with everyone else.  The worst part? There is nothing more I can do than wait and react.</p>

			 <p>Bullet journalling was introduced 9 years ago. I know because I remember the very first website and how it totally transformed how I did things at work.

<p>Very cool, except the most basic of things, a reference guide to the system is nowhere to be found. I think this is a colossal loss and missed opportunity. BuJo should be about the <em>system</em> first and foremost.  Let those that can benefit from the simplicity of the system run with it.</p>

			 <p>It’s been an entire month in the city of Toronto. A month in I can definitely say that I am starting to get this place a little and starting to really love it as well.</p>
<p>I have tried a few eateries. A lunchtime Mexican, an Afghani, Italian and a Harry’s burger. All were excellent except a pizza place on Dundas. Totally overpriced and never to receive my patronage again (I always vote with my wallet).</p>
<p>Canada is not a <em>slightly</em> different version of America. It’s actually a <em>very</em> different version. Sure the big highways exist, but the train, bus, tram networks are clearly more robust. The architecture is different. The stores are different. The people landscape is very different.</p>
<h2 id="bumps--bashes">Bumps &amp; Bashes</h2>
<p>The biggest and most painful issue has been the fact that I have not really been able to see my family in this entire month. That has been the hardest part of this journey so far. It’s also been unnecessarily delayed by the Canadian government that has not been able to issue a simple enough visa (even though the original timeline was a week). At the moment things are all over the place and causing major disruption. It’s not clear when things might settle down.</p>
<p>Every start is difficult. This one has been much more difficult that it needed to be.</p>

			 <p>I have been patiently waiting for a book. A book that was released some 10 years ago, with a second edition meant to be released in May of this year. A book that would help me understand the country I have just moved to, <em>A concise History of Canada</em>.</p>
<p>For months the books release has been delayed and seemingly the only place you can buy this book is on Amazon and even then it is at a considerable premium. It&rsquo;s like they really don&rsquo;t want this book to succeed. Or bury the thoughts and ideas found inside. What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I imagine the updated version will have a nice chunky section (or at least it should) about the Canadian colonial genocide of the First Nations people across the decades (a slow systematic system to erase a culture and people that got an apology from the Pope a few weeks ago). Even in a progressive country like Canada, fear of the <em>different</em> is a powerful urge that should not be enabled. Ever.</p>

<p>Since my digital detox from 2 years ago, I have been looking for a good source of ‘news’. Most news websites don’t offer the type of coverage that I crave and never in the form that I want it. I subscribed to <em>The Economist</em> for a few months but the regularity meant I could read nothing more. What I wanted was a dense version published less frequently that let me get into a specific topic more than superficially. Turns out form factor and package matters.</p>
<p>Yesterday we went to a bookstore. In this post pandemic world that is a novelty and something many members of the my family have not done. It wasn’t the largest bookstore I have been to but it was several orders bigger than anything in Copenhagen.   I unabashedly fell in love. I could have spent the whole day there.</p>
<p>Because of our imminent move to Canada, I refrained from buying more than a single paperback tome of <em><a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org">American Affairs</a></em>, and with it I think I have found my source of ‘news’ and commentary in a vessel that I can absolutely get behind. Put together like a novel, the ‘magazine’ is 99.5% text (with the occasional graph or image). The articles are dense and let you delve into the subject. The paper is emasculate. The cover stock is sublime. The typography outstanding.</p>
<p>Best of all, it’s quarterly. One of the instant subscriptions when I get a permanent place in Canada.</p>

			 <p>Based on a <em>semi</em> deep dive into the articles published by <a href="https://micro.blog/jasraj">@jasraj</a>, I discovered the missing software needed in my book formatting arsenal, <a href="https://www.atticus.io">Atticus</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a web based tool for formatting and previewing ePubs across devices. Big bonus is the fact that it allows for a ton of things that I couldn’t achieve using Kindle Create. The downside is that it is a little on the pricey side. My thinking is that had I known about this service I would have released my Kindle version months ago. Also the amount of time spent formatting would have been considerably less. Finally, the cost across one book is high. It keeps dropping as I add more books (which I have in the can at the moment).</p>
<p>Based on how it goes with this tool, might also look to use <a href="https://publisherrocket.com">Publisher Rocket</a> as well.</p>

			 <p>Now that I have completed putting my book up for sale (in all the places I intend to sell it in) thought it would be good to record the experience and what I learnt (in case others might be looking to replicate the journey).</p>
<h2 id="editions">Editions</h2>
<p>All in all there are 4 editions across 4 stores:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stetbuild.gumroad.com/l/bec01">Digital Edition</a>. This is hosted on Gumroad. Comes in two flavours, pdf and Epub3.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/khaled-abou-alfa/built-environment-compendium-vol1/paperback/product-pz9pm5.html?page=1&amp;pageSize=4">Paperback Edition</a>. This is a print on demand copy and honestly my favourite version - but I am very old school like that. The only difference for this edition is the lack of full blue page blue insert at the start of the book. I found that this page impacted the binding. This edition also comes with an index at the end (more on that in a bit).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5KS962W">Amazon Kindle Edition</a>. This does away with the double page photo images that break the chapters. The graphs and tables are images and does not have an index.</li>
<li>Apple Bookstore Edition. The exact Epub3 file. This one is coming soon, as it’s being reviewed by Apple.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>Nearly 3 years ago I lost my Mac. At the time there were rumours of Apple silicone on the horizon and it didn’t feel like the right time to make a purchase that would least me at least 5 years. My only machine was my 2018 iPad Pro, a device with hardware that was (and is?) way ahead of it’s competition. All that was missing was suitable software.</p>
<p>My original hope was that Affinity would release their desktop publishing app, Publisher, on the iPad relatively soon. We’re still waiting for that release. What I found was the incredibly capable Pages app that could do <em>just</em> about everything I wanted. It did take a while to get used to understanding how some of these things were setup, but being able to edit things across my iPad and iPhone allowed me to iterate at a much faster rate.</p>
<p>Being able to share comments and update a file between myself and Mike (my editor) made the editing process seamless. This space could be better in keeping the comments history (after you’ve accepted the comments), but honestly it’s a nitpick at this stage.</p>
<p>The one feature that I hope Apple adds is the ability to create an Index. This was by far the most time consuming and painful exercise - and which I had to do manually. What is encouraging is that Apple continues to update this app several times a year and continues to make it even more capable with every iteration.</p>
<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>For Gumroad, creating a pdf and an Epub was trivial. As was uploading to the Apple Bookstore. The web interface for iTuneConnect is ok. You can tell which parts are still legacy from before Apple decided to take the web more seriously but overall no complaints.</p>
<p>Reformatting for Amazon was painful but <em>hopefully</em> worthwhile. For this edition I had to move off my iPad Pro and onto a Windows machine I have access to. Export from Pages to Word. Import it into Kindle Create and then go about formatting everything to suit the different format (ePub2?). Sadly I feel that this is a lesser edition than the others on account of not being able to provide some of the native elements that I have included in the other versions (full page images, native tables and graphes). Having said that everything looks sharp on both my Kindle Paperwhite and my iPhone.</p>
<p>I gave up on Draft2Digital pretty quickly because the final version was asking for too many compromises. My text and supplementary images don’t marry well with the type of book that service is catering towards. If you have a  ‘novel’ type of  book (a cover and then text), then this system will work a charm for you. Everyone else, it’s probably an exercise in frustration.</p>
<hr>
<p>This has been a really incredible journey for me. From my original ideas of creating these concise books, I now have my first release across several stores and formats. The barrier to entry is exceedingly low, considering that apart from using a windows machine for a day to format the Kindle edition, everything else was done on an iPad (including all the illustrations). Creatively this has been one of the most complete things I have ever worked on. I have 3 more in the tank, although none have gone through the editing process yet. Now that I know the process, hopefully the next ones will come out faster.</p>

			 <p>Spent the entire day formatting my book using Kindle Create.<br>
What a collosal pain in the ass of a programme.<br>
I mean seriously Amazon, sort your applications out. You&rsquo;re a technology company with a leading role in the book industry. Their tool is piss poor. A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>You cannot format numbered lists or tables.</li>
<li>Certain images cannot be moved around (you have to delete and start again)</li>
<li>Full page images are not possible in the app.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t even bother with graphs.</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t format the style of the contents page (not in any meaningful way).</li>
<li>Covers are uploaded separately, so you don&rsquo;t get to see the entire thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have read a lot of books on my Kindle and yet this lack of finesse is only apparent to me with books that you can tell were not originally intended for this type of format. I have tried my best to create a great Kindle book, but I know it could have been even better, if Amazon had sorted their application out to make best use of their own readers.</p>

			 <p>What a ride.</p>
<p>It’s been just shy of 3 years in Denmark. We arrived in the autumn of 2019, filled with enthusiasm and optimism. Fast forward 3 months and we were in lockdown. Being a husband and father during these times was incredibly taxing. Fundamental ideologies between people in the same household would clash. Mine was no different. The common ground for us was fear for our kids. Some would untangle themselves from this mess relatively quickly while we would take years.</p>
<p>I really underestimated the difficulty of the language and it’s overall importance to being able to integrate into the society. This is used as a test really. As a means of separating the wheat from the chaff. Clearly my family were chaff. For all those considering a move, go listen to some Danish and see if it triggers the right happy receptors for you. It’s an important litmus test.</p>
<p>What I will miss about Denmark is the scale. Generally everything is on a human scale. I will miss riding my bike in a country filled with bikes. My work and office which I really felt a part of. I’ll miss the team.</p>
<p>Throughout all this upheaval, we were trying to get to grips and understand this decidedly different nation. Denmark is different by choice, not by accident. Proudly different and incredibly protectionist. There is no Amazon. A handful of MacDonalds (I think 3). Starbucks is not a thing. There are instead local brands and a few (emphasis on few) non-Denmark brands. This lack of <em>choice</em> is by design.</p>
<p>At first I loved the simplicity, but then after a little while I also started craving things that I did not have simple access to. Being part of the European Union means that most of these things are within reach relatively easily, <em>mostly</em> online. But you’re not going to buy chocolate online. Or Franks hot sauce. Or different types of crisps. Or tea. Maybe coffee. A choice beyond a single school for the kids which you might or might not be able to get them into. This lack of choice was something that Mindy (friend from work) would talk about. For her it was salad dressing. Sometimes you need choice. Sometimes it’s about getting more than 2 types of salad dressing.</p>

			 <p>Turns out I like creating my own yearly traditions. Every year, for the last 6, I have changed the colours of my site (this is the first year that the design was also changed, more on that in a future post).</p>
<p>Every year, for the last 3 years I buy a new watch. These are not crazy priced watches, by any stretch of the imagination, but modestly priced watches with a function . The collection grows steadily and I get to spend a good amount of time enjoying what I purchased.</p>
<p>For a great part of the year I was sure my yearly purchase was going to be a red dialed Orient Kamasu. Then I was convinced that it was going to be a blue faced automatic watch of some description. I was seesawing between a Christopher Ward Sealander and a Seiko Baby Alpinist. Honestly I can think of any number of others things I can spend $1000 on - maybe in the far and distant future.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2022/098b085e21.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Alas, like last year (when I opted for a Vaer Field watch), I went for a brand I was aware of but the cost and function won me over. In this case a Mondaine Helvetica GMT. Moving to Canada means that my parents are in a completely different timezone. Sometimes I do the mental arithmetic needed, sometimes I pull out my phone and check out <a href="https://medium.com/@komarov/apple-watch-journey-learning-through-doing-474b23c65121">World Clock</a> (one of my favourite apps that has an excellent use case of haptic feedback). I wasn’t looking for a GMT, but when I saw it, I thought this might actually come in a little handy, glance down, what time is it in Europe/Middle East? Got it.</p>
<p>I’d never seen this particular model before - although I do not pay a great deal of attention to what Mondaine have been up to. Obviously I loved the Erik Spiekermann designed watch faces but this one hit all the right notes for me, except of course it’s not an automatic. I think this is another <em>functional</em> watch for me to enjoy.</p>

<p>A death doesn’t become real to me until I write about what this person meant to me. Sadly family ‘obituaries’ have become a familiar subject for me to write about. I write them to help me remember and <em>celebrate the life</em> of those that have just left us.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2022/d004ecd1fd.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My relationship with Jamal started as my oldest brother-in-law, over the years however I came to see him a little differently. Coming into my wife’s family I would be their ‘fourth’ brother. The age difference was a little jarring but amusing at the same time. Jamal, being of my mother’s age, told me a joke that my mother had told me 20 years earlier.</p>
<p>When I was still in Lebanon, in what seems like several lifetimes ago, I remember a conversation I had with him before we decided to leave. I ended it by saying something to the effect that ‘Lebanon was no longer built for its people, it was built for foreigners.’ He clearly agreed because a couple of years after that he had migrated his entire life over to the United States.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Memento Mori. Remember you will die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody better embodies this concept as a cautionary tale than Jamal. His passing was both shocking but also <em>not</em> so shocking. I knew his wanton disregard for improving his health was shortening his life, but I had no idea (nor did anyone else) just how much shorter that was going to be. Jamal struggled with his weight. This was one of his weaknesses and from there it would spiral into any number of issues that plagued him throughout his life. I’m (slightly) angry at him because he left us exceedingly early. Time and memories were taken away from us.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after he had moved to Florida, I visited him in his new house and spent a tiny bit of time with him. It was brief but he relished showing me around and his then setup.  What I liked about him was his energy for entertaining others, for being around others. Jamals barbecuing was legendary.  He was a master storyteller, sometime stretched a little (but always entertaining) and sprinkled with <em>just</em> the right amount of Lebanese bullshit.</p>
<p>He possessed a child like enthusiasm, which is probably why he loved interacting with kids. Maybe because he looked like Santa, white hair and beard, that kids loved him as well. He didn’t have any grandchildren of his own, but my kids were probably the closest he got to that feeling.</p>
<p>From time to time he would send me little videos and jokes. A small little curated collection of his humour. Every time I received one, I would just imagine his laugh and understand why he would send these over to me.</p>

			 <p>I write and draw because I absolutely love it. I do it because I find tremendous value in the research, writing and creation process and hopefully you find value in receiving these missives as well.</p>
<p>I don’t however have a team of people doing things for me. I am the sole person responsible for everything around these parts. Doing many things, which I enjoy, takes time. Having an infinite weekly deadline doesn’t really work for me now that I have to split my attention across multiple channels (the newsletter, the books, the website).</p>
<p>And so my <em>In Abeyance</em> <a href="https://www.stet.build/ia">newsletter</a> is moving to a ‘seasons’ model.</p>
<p>My intention is to give myself the summer off. Write season 5 and release it in the autumn. The size of each season will depend, but I imagine between 6 and 12 issues. Each season will have a theme, with the next season concentrating on ports. Airports. Shipping ports. Spaceports. Their history, economics, design and future.</p>

			 <p>The <em>Built Environment Compendium</em>, while the work of three years, is actually the very start of the journey with all things <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a>. I am incredibly excited about how the first book turned out - even more so now that physical copies are available.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am however still learning what works and what doesn’t work in the indie self-publishing world. Pricing was something that I did agonise over a fair amount. I loved the idea that <a href="https://sive.rs/bp">Derek Sivers</a> uses however it didn’t really work for me.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to change the pricing model for the books, but only after I took care of the super early (and incredible) supporters by sending them a paperback version of the book as well (these are now all in the post and on their way). They now have all the versions for <em>roughly</em> the same price as the new pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stetbuild.gumroad.com/l/bec01">Digital Edition ➔</a>: $4.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/gb/shop/khaled-abou-alfa/built-environment-compendium-vol1/paperback/product-pz9pm5.html?page=1&amp;pageSize=4">Paperback ➔</a>: $12.99 / €12.99 / 17.99AUD / £10.99 / 17.99CAD</li>
</ul>
<p>The final version I am currently working on is the Kindle version. This will likely be priced the same as the digital version and will hopefully drop sometime in the summer.</p>
<p>For all those who have bought it already I want to thank you for the support and would love to hear back from you. For those still on the fence, consider buying a copy (or 2), it’s a concise package of goodness about how the world is built.</p>

Making is hard because it requires perseverance, patience, practice. It also requires you to grow as a person capable of regular and incremental decisions. Decisions that all together, in concert, guide the <em>thing</em> to become a reality.</p>

			 <p>🍱 The single most important tool in my kitchen is my digital scales. The thing is I have been focusing on measuring the ingredients that go into a meal. Portion control has been left to my <em>hungry</em> eye. Today the penny dropped and I will be measuring the amount on my plate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the carbs around 180-200g.</li>
<li>If a sauce is involved go up to 300g.</li>
<li>If a meat/chicken/fish is involved aim for 100-120g. Top up with the vegetables to reach the 500g mark.</li>

			 <p>The Hobonichi Techo is marketed as a ‘LifeBook’ and for several years I bought into the marketing. The biggest issue I had with the product was the sheer number of wasted space on all the peripheral ornamentation that adorns each page. Fast forward a few years and I went and got myself one of the cheapest Muji A6 blank notebooks, an impulse buy but realised that <em>this</em> is my LifeBook.</p>
<p>What I’ve appreciated is the blank canvas that allows me to use it whenever and for whatever. Everything goes into here. Random thoughts. Email. Ideas for presentations. Ideas for blog posts. Todo lists items. How is this different to a number of Field Notes? Cost ($2.90) and pages (144 pages!). Great value. <a href="https://www.muji.us/collections/notebook/products/recycled-paper-bind-plain-pocket-notebook-9s62">Highly recommended</a>.</p>

Access to pen shows and comic conventions. Access to large English book stores. Access to North American products that would get crazy taxed in Europe.</p>

			 <p>That was disappointing. Just got a printed copy of my book from Lulu.com. A little over a year ago I got a similar print which I thought came out really well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2022/46c0198818.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Fast forward to today and  the results are not the same. For a start the binding is worse and the cover has separated already from the front page.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2022/8210b76c45.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are issues with the printing alignment - checked the pdf and everything is fine at the source.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2509/2022/579a9588f1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The colours have been printed in CMYK, even though previously they would be done in an RGB palette. I’m pretty sure this is a different printing house (the book came from France rather Spain).</p>
<p>Also, so far noticed one small error which I am correcting as I also pull together the Kindle version as well.</p>

			 <p>We had a mindfulness workshop at work last week. My biggest take away was maintaining a daily gratitude log. Minimum of 3 things that I am grateful for <em>and that I made a direct contribution to</em>. The 2nd part is what made it all click. This makes me look for these small contributions throughout my day and by reliving these at the end of my day.</p>
<p>Initially I was going to do this in my paper journal but I have found that using DayOne is the perfect place for these thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-collecting">Understanding Collecting</h3>
<p>As human beings we are constantly <em>accumulating</em> and <em>collecting</em> - information, data, objects, memories, scars, pain, email, experiences and so on. This explains why there are so many methods, courses, apps and products designed to help you categorise, manage, store or replace items within your collections.</p>
<p>You will never cease to <em>collect</em> until the day you die. It’s part of being a <strong>human</strong>. The intention of <em>Sensible Defaults</em> is to start making you more mindful of the existing items in your life and allow you to consider any new ones that you choose to add. The intention is <strong>not</strong> to achieve the perfect equilibrium, as this will likely be a fools errand. Your needs will change throughout your life and constantly reviewing the items in your life in this manner is exhausting.</p>
<p>The aim rather is to allow you to arrive at a moderate point along your journey whereby <em>most</em> of your surroundings blend around you and where everything has it’s place and provides a specific function in your life.</p>
<p>There will be outlier elements that will likely need to be considered separately. Don’t get bogged down with these items to begin with. Turn your focus to the low hanging fruit first.</p>
<h3 id="the-physical-the-digital--the-mind">The Physical, the Digital &amp; the Mind</h3>
<p>Most people’s world is occupied across three distinct containers, the <em>physical</em>, the <em>digital</em> and that vast expanse of the <em>mind</em>.</p>
<p>This does not define every human being on earth. There are people in this world with no electricity, much less internet access and for those millions a digital container is irrelevant. However the other two containers <em>definitely</em> remain relevant.</p>
<p>Each container plays an important role in defining many aspects of our lives. Left unchecked, the containers have the potential to add infinite amounts of weight and baggage over time, like weeds in a garden.</p>
<p>The <em>physical</em> world is the most readily apparent, as everything associated with this container ultimately surrounds us, in plain view. While the <em>digital</em> world can be infinitely larger and potentially more dangerous if not taken into account and understood and managed. Finally, the <em>mind</em> has the absolute biggest impact on everything, as it will impact the way you interact with each of the other two container and has the most power over you.</p>
<p>The first step is to accept the concept of trying to divide your life into these three spaces and then providing the necessary maintenance to each one throughout different phases of your life.</p>

			 <p>This is the second week that I have sent out my <em>In Abeyance</em> newsletter using the new format. What I love about this new format is that it really is very low friction for me. I get an idea or see something interesting within my week. I write about 500 words around the subject, do some research and don’t overthink it too much. It’s sustainable and long term will not put too much strain on all the other things that I am involved with.</p>

			 <p>Building something is difficult.<br>
It take incredible patience.<br>
It takes conviction.<br>
And it takes belief.<br>
Belief that things will eventually resonate with a wider audience. Belief in that this thing you are building is the best use of your time. What is the opportunity cost? Are you a victim of the sunken cost fallacy?</p>
<p>Even though I have been building Stet for 3½ years now, in many respects the road begins now, with the very first publication out. Creatively speaking, Stet has been one of my most consistent outlets. It has allowed me to combine all the things that I love to do in a consistent manner. My only concern however is that it is not reaching the wider audience that I imagined for it.</p>
<p>I had hoped that creating something good and useful would yield more reach. I was wrong. At the moment it is a <em>creative</em> distraction. Maybe I overestimated the audience of people interested in <em>reading</em> concise and (I want to believe) interesting articles about the built environment?</p>
<h2 id="advertising">Advertising</h2>
<p>I have dipped my toe into Twitter ads, but I feel that this isn’t exactly where my audience is. Rather the one that appear to ‘engage’ more with my posts are definitely living (lurking?) on LinkedIn. The thing is it seems that barrier for entry into this space is $120 minimum from any campaign. Seems like burning $120. I don’t mind betting on myself, what I do mind is betting on myself when LinkedIn makes the rules and I have no idea what the outcome could be.</p>
<h2 id="newsletter">Newsletter</h2>
<p>I have been meaning to review what and how I write about this particular newsletter. I really believe in the format. I love sending it out. I love writing and have really developed a love for it. I love the research, I would do the research and write even if it wasn’t being shared with others. However I did conflate two issues. Writing 2000 word essays is a commitment from anyone to read. It has also lacked a consistent publishing schedule this past year. My antidote to all of this has been to reduce the size of what I am sending out but generally send it out every week.</p>

			 <p>Not been writing much on the site. Mentally I like my small piece of the internet to be filled with information and thoughts <em>of interest</em>. To myself in the future and to others right now.</p>
<p>This period reminds me of a terrible period in the mid-2010s. One night in particular I went to sleep holding my then 3 year old tightly and crying at the state of the world (<a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees">I just searched for an article and the emotion flooded back</a>).</p>
<p>Sadly our world is one filled with war. Some more brutal than others. It feels that the conflicts are getting larger, but Iraq is a big place. Syria was home to 22 million people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.….<br>
— Winston S Churchill, 11 November 1947</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://stetbuild.gumroad.com/l/bec01">grab a freshly minted copy</a> of my first book the <em>Built Environment Compendium Vol.01</em>. If you are actively curious about the built environment, this book is for you.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2019/04/25/a-year-of.html">written about</a> how the idea behind <a href="https://www.stet.build/">Stet.Build</a> came to me. I quickly set about developing the ideas on my study wall. Never shared this photo but easily one of my favourite exercises when brain storming. In the top right hand corner you can see the original sketch for what I wanted the covers to look like. Also its interesting to see my thoughts on pricing which have evolved since then.</p>

<p>The last year has been all about editing and polishing the script and thankfully had Mike Summers, who was the perfect editor, because he cares about the English languages and its nuances. He pushed and he prodded. He questioned and he commented. We did it all using Pages. Technology has evolved to remove incredible amounts of friction and this has been a perfect example of this. Right there baked into my phone and iPad.</p>

			 <p>We were in Italy and my dad got me my Swiss army knife. It was part of being a Cub Scout. Fast forward some 30 years and I still have that knife. It works, but it’s received no maintenance in that time. It’s squeaky. The knife is blunt. The scissors don’t work. The vibrant red plastic is covered in scratches and the logo has been worn away completely. Trying to open some of the additional features is playing roulette with your fingernails. But the thing works. And I have used it for the odd job for decades.</p>
<p>I’m all about buying purposefully. So I decided to get a pocket knife upgrade. Down the rabbit hole I went. Everything has a passion group around it. Knives is no different. The sites celebrate knife designers. Materials and terms I have never heard. The costs escalate quickly as soon as the country of origin moves away from Asia. I <em>think</em> I will go for the <a href="https://www.foxcutlery.com/n/en/product/2324/fx-608_bl.html">Fox Baby Core</a> in blue…although I am categorically a n00b here, so someone might tell me that I have got this all wrong.</p>

I’m sure there were plenty of gems there, but somehow it didn’t really matter to me. I hadn’t used the service as anything more than a graveyard for links. Although my brain was telling me that all I needed was a nice list, in practice I need something <em>different</em>. Sometimes the tool creates a mental hinderance.</p>
<p><a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop.io</a>, might be a better way for me to collect and organise my links in a manner that I actually <em>use</em> them in the future. The main difference is that it can be as visual as I want it to be, allowing the happy triggers in my brain to fire. I decided to centre around collections (rather than tags) and just be purposeful at the addition of things in here. Lets see if this works better for me.</p>

<li>It’s hooked up to a number of text editors (I subscribe to Drafts <em>just</em> to post to my site).</li>
<li>It gets beamed everywhere. WordPress. Tumblr. Twitter. Email newsletter (which needs some TLC).</li>
<li>I use it to track my book reading. This one is an outlier feature, but I love it.</li>
<li>It transports me back in time every day to past years and what was on my mind that day (one of my favourite features and that’s a plug-in).</li>
<li>Gives me an excuse to take photos of things.</li>

			 <p>2021 was the year of learning. What I have learnt is that in fact I want this to be a constant part of my life. Every year should in some form be the <em>year of learning</em>. This year is when I would say that I finally learnt how to cook. Gaining confidence in the kitchen is an amazing superpower and one I hope to share with my boys. I learnt how to ride a cargo bike. I learnt how to juggle. I learnt about coffee beans (the last space in the coffee world that has eluded me while I learnt brewing techniques).</p>
<p>For 2022, I have decided it shall be the year of momentum. I have put several things in place that I need to continue to build more and more momentum around. Things that I started 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 3 years ago are all on the cusp of bearing fruit. I will persevere through these and make sure I give it my very best. Central to all this is the understanding that you can only control your own actions and reactions. The rest is either a direct consequence or outside your control or ability to influence.</p>

			 <p>I don’t typically do this, but I thought it would be useful to consider the major items I bought this year. Since moving to Denmark I am increasingly more aware of the purchases we make, because frankly they are limited compared to our materialistic lifestyle in Dubai.</p>
<h2 id="røde-microphone">Røde microphone</h2>
<p>This was the first piece of electronics I bought this year. Excellent build quality. Great size. I never used it beyond a couple of test files. This isn’t to say that I won’t, just that I didn’t incorporate this into my life in 2022. In 2022 I would like to release a single episode at least once a month.</p>
<h2 id="vaer-watch">Vaer Watch</h2>
<p>While not electronics, this was the first major purchase of the year. I have decided that I want to generally pace my watch buying to a single timepiece a year. This is a marathon not a sprint. The intention is to slowly build up my collection with purpose. While this watch does not have the heritage of many other watch brands, what I liked about it is that it fit into my yearly sub-theme, which is trying to get <em>sensible defaults</em> in place.</p>
<h2 id="aoc-screen">AOC screen</h2>
<p>For the start of the pandemic I was using my little laptop screen as my primary device. There was a beauty to basically closing my laptop screen at the end of the week, leaving my desk clean for anything I wanted to do. When it became clear that we are in this for a while longer, I bought myself the largest screen that I thought would be compatible in our tiny little apartment. Its a 4K job. While nowhere near the density of my iPad Pro, it offers a huge step forward from everything work provides, while also setting me up nicely for one of my primarily purchases for next year.</p>
<h2 id="kindle-paperwhite">Kindle Paperwhite</h2>
<p>This was a replacement after 8 years with the previous model. A real upgrade. Glad that I waited as long as I did for this upgrade. At this rate I will get the next one at the end of 2029.</p>
<h2 id="soundcore-q30-earphones">Soundcore Q30 earphones</h2>
<p>This is a <em>downgrade</em> from my Sony WX1000, except they are not really. They function excellently, they just don’t <em>feel</em> premium, because they are not. I bought these because I also got the next item as a replacement. These lasted me a hair under 4 years. The issue was a bit of plastic. Tried to fix it but alas it had to be replaced. At 1/3 the price of the WX1000s, my thinking is that as long as these current ones last over 1.5 years then I am winning.</p>
<h2 id="jabra-elite-75t">Jabra Elite 75T</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2021/05/26/i-walk-out.html">Last year I lost one earbud</a>. After many months of looking at the alternative, I decide to bite the bullet and re-order these. What I realised is that the case is super important. The overall design and how this thing fits into your ear is super important. The noise cancelling is super important. Jabra hits all of these at a reasonable price (when compared to the alternatives).</p>
<h2 id="ikea-modular-couch">Ikea Modular Couch</h2>
<p>We tried to keep using the makeshift Ikea day bed we brought with us from Dubai. It lasted a little under 2 years. It has been a wonderful addition to our living space and adding the lounge section was essential.</p>
<h2 id="babboe-cargo-curve">Babboe Cargo Curve</h2>
<p>We went native with this one and got ourselves a cargo bike. When in Denmark and all that. This is probably Ryan’s favourite thing in the world. He loves vehicles and I can’t wait to use it in the spring and summer to take them all over the city.</p>
<hr>
<p>Looking at the coming year, the three items I am looking at buying is a Mac Mini, the next watch (looking closely at the <a href="https://www.seikowatches.com/us-en/products/prospex/spb157">Seiko SPB157</a>) and possibly an ivory Pro Gear. Of course I imagine there will be some unscheduled items I will be forced to replace…</p>

			 <p>It has been <em>years</em> since I designed a completely new website. My toolbox of tricks has remained mostly the same - still using <a href="https://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a>, which I absolutely love. What has been fascinating is the scope a modern website now needs to serve. Now you have to effectively design four websites in one - desktop, tablet, mobile and dark mode.</p>
<h2 id="desktop">Desktop</h2>
<p>Version 2.0 of <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a>, which has seen very little love since it was launched 3 years ago, is a huge leap forward. I’m glad I took the time to make this the best it can be. I always recognised this was a major project and this has taken me around 6 months to complete (not full time of course).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The mock-ups were done in <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/">Affinity Designer</a> - probably over a decade since I have used a vector app to design a website. For the most part I was able to replicate these. The annoying part was loosing some of the mock-ups half way through the design process due to some random name saving error. Top tip, save your work outside the Affinity system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of my favourite features of the new site, is the archive feature. A little bit of javascript and filtering the table like magic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2>
<p>When it came to the mobile version, I left it to serendipity and let the pieces fall. I could have spent a little time on this during the mockup stage, however I think that it worked out well in the end.</p>
<h2 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h2>
<p>This was (and remains) the biggest hurdle. This issue was that the individual artwork looked completely out of place in its native form with the bright white background. The only way around this is to recreate 51 drawings that are more suited to the darker background. This is going to be a work in progress as it is not a top priority - but will get to it all eventually. <a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/050">Issue 50</a> shows where I am heading with this.</p>
<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
<p>Finished the mock ups months ago but needed the space (mentally) to dive into the coding. Certainly rusty, I leant into my constraints. My primary machine is my iPad Pro. I lost my MacBook a couple of years ago, and due to all the Apple laptop keyboard fiasco I never pressed the button. I began coding this on the iPad, but it really was an exercise in misery. Forget what they say, the iPad does not have the versatility for something like web production. Until Apple bring the Dev tools over with Safari, its all counterproductive.</p>
<p>The overall <a href="https://www.blot.im">Blot</a> system also made it super easy to work on the site while everything else was live. Probably the best setup for developing a website I have ever worked one. Local files that I save and see the impact direct on the site. Genius implementation.</p>

I was totally sceptical about this, but it completely captured their imagination in a way that no other Lego set has. Zane then asked for a Sonic version of the same.</p>

			 <p>Its like having a super power. For my entire life I have been one of those really annoying people that could fall asleep pretty much instantly. As soon as, or often just before, my head hits the pillow I am comically <em>out</em>. The drawback has always been getting back to sleep after I have been woken up. I will only decide to pick up digital media after tossing for an hour or more in bed trying desperately to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>I saw a quick post on Kottke, which ultimately is explained <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breathing-technique-get-sleep-seconds-113218066.html?guccounter=1">in this link</a>. Breathing exercise to help you go to sleep. I didn’t follow this exactly, but remember the hold your breathe part while you inhale/exhale. Have been trying it for several days and it works! Easily one of the most important things that I have learnt this year. The <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2020/12/30/year-of-learning.html">Year of Learning</a> continues to rock on.</p>

			 <p>Got an email this morning that <a href="https://live.amcharts.com">amCharts</a> is shutting down its live website in the coming 6 months. This is one of the clear reasons for not relying on a service that you cannot easily replace. At the start of Stet.Build, I incorporated several graphs into my articles. For the last few years I have avoided this as creating and maintaining these is not based around simple and standard solutions - unless the landscape has changed?</p>

<p>Latest issue of my newsletter <em>In Abeyance</em> is finally out. Over the last year I have fallen out of my routine for writing in the morning. Part of this has been due to my regular work creeping outside it’s time boundaries.</p>
<p>I have considered making the newsletter easier to write (by writing less) but that defeats the whole point of this endeavour. What I have settled on is accepting that sometimes I will be late but (hopefully) worth the wait.</p>
<hr>
<p>Surrounding your desk.<br>
Around your television media area.<br>
Across your kitchen (over and under the counters).<br>
Deep inside your walls.<br>
Running under your feet.<br>
They deliver power and signals.<br>
Cables are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Yet even for an electrical engineer like myself, it would be difficult to argue that they are great to have around. They get tangled up. They fray. They are a necessary evil.</p>
<p>What a glorious place it would be if all your appliances and devices where always charged and ready to go. Wireless power. An idea nearly as old as electricity itself.</p>

Nothingness and everything, in a space that is both completely dark and bright at the same time. Except thats not true. In the abyss is a tiny point. Except its not a point at all. Its a seed. A seed both glowing and stealing light at the same time. Finally after seconds or maybe it is millennia, a bright, luminescent green seed begins to sprout.<br>

Recognising their stalemate, out of desperation the energies begin to devour each other. Like a snake eating it&rsquo;s tail. They inch closer and closer to each other.

As the battles continues the two energies manifest further as two distinct entities. One as an angry and violent concubine of spikes exploding in every direction.

It doesn&rsquo;t take very long for the first signs of a struggle to begin. The attacks come from both sides, like soft waves crashing onto the side of thorny rocks.

Recognising that this dance cannot continue forever, they shift their strategies. It is not in their nature to live in harmony with each other. One or the other must become dominant.

The energies remain distinct but futilely try and achieve a balance in each other’s presence. This effort offers no result as the draw to overpower is too strong. This leads them instead to engulf each other. First seen as tiny pins of light in the vastness of the black. The pins grow until they all but consume the dark leaving small black specks, like vanilla seeds in milk. Again and again this sequence repeats itself. Again and again.</p>

Like two different seas they gently collide. At first the push and pull is gentle, almost soothing in its nature. Back and forth. A gentle wave on the sea.

Constantly in motion.</p>

The Iyes grow at a speed that stretches through an eternity. They mature in tandem with each other. At first there is harmony. Their coexistence is barely registered by the other. They grow in gentle movements, swaying and flowing into each other. Their growth never ends. Eventually they begin to occupy all the conceivable space around them. Where one starts the other ends. Around and around, to infinity.</p>

In the stillness of infinity and at the edge of chaos, they manifest simultaneously. Although they share the same spectrum they exist on either end of it. Their energies and purpose in direct opposition to the other. One forcing the blackest of realities. The other offering the brightest of hopes.</p>

			 <p>November is nearly upon us. For two years now I have been writing a short story every November. 50 words a day equates to roughly 1500 words a month. In the past I have tried to create completely original ideas that I had never worked on before. This year I have decided to write an idea I had 20 years ago. The story has had many false starts, however I have the overall direction mapped out.</p>
<p>Rather than worrying about doing the story justice, I’m just going to dive into this and see how and where it goes. It is a commitment, because the story won’t be anywhere near done this year. It will take many years to complete at this pace, either way I am really looking forward to sharing this story finally.</p>

			 <h1 id="fallen-off-the-s-wagon">Fallen off the S-Wagon</h1>
<p>I have fallen off the S-diet wagon these last few months. It has been the accumulation of any number of issues. Breakfast and everything till lunch is fine. Lunch is usually fine (rarely seconds) and no snacking until I finish work.</p>
<p>5pm onwards is where the wheels usually come off. The first snack hits. It’s small. Then the seconds come in. Then, depending on how tough the day was, I have a snack in the late evening as well.The evening for me has always been the tricky period to maintain the way I eat.</p>
<p>It seems to be a question of planning. Planning the evening meals so they happen at the right time and that they are a celebration (rather than just good enough) because then there is an incentive to snack or have seconds.</p>

			 <h1 id="going-electric">Going Electric</h1>
<p>Been recently moving around the city on my electric powered Babboe and it has been  <em>transformational</em>. The ability to travel several km within a safe dedicated bicycle lane, without breaking a sweat and worrying about traffic and parking on the other end is magical.</p>
<p>Being in control of the amount of energy that I exert on a given distance travelled is an amazing incentive of actually using the bike more regularly. There surely is a time and a place for a car, however depending on your daily life this might not actually be all that important really.</p>
<p>I certainly never intend to buy another non electric bike ever again. To all those ‘purists’ thinking about it as a torture exercise, it becomes a mega chore when it’s combined to a daily commute, in all types of weather.</p>

			 <p>I have a new form of obsession, finding my own <em>sensible defaults</em>. I am tantalisingly close to getting most of the way there for a number of aspects of my life. The more defaults I can add, the easier life flows and opens up the opportunity for me to explore beyond the mundane. Although this year was originally intended to be the year of learning, it really has turned into the year of sensible defaults. From clothes, to technology, to the house, to my thoughts and ideas, to what I need.</p>
<p>Every item that is <em>allowed</em> entry into my life has to enhance it in a meaningful and long term manner. Short term gains (such as the euphoria of having purchased something) is very much a thing of the past for me. Impulse buys are not allowed. Every item in my surroundings has a target on its back - unless I have some use for this item, it’s days are limited (sometimes it does take me a little while to get there but get there I do).</p>

			 <p>As of today I am a 42 year old stoic believer (I have much road to travel on this road). I have also begun my path towards a better understanding of myself and what is important to me. I now use this marker to reflect. Did I use this year wisely? Did I gain new experiences that I will remember 5 or 10 years from today? Did I create anything that I will be able to share with others? Was I a good father? A good husband? A good mentor, brother, son, cousin? I continue to live my life. Raise my children. Write. Draw. Learn. I continue down a path of self realisation and trying my best to determine what is essential and what is enough.</p>

			 <p>I thought it would be fine. We would take it nice and slow. It’s a straight line, soft downhill with a a few turns at the very end. The thing is it really has been pretty stressful these last few days taking and bringing Zane from school on his bike. Every jut out in the road I see as a trap. Even though it is only 10min on the bike, his concentration <em>meanders</em>. I occasionally see him where he shouldn’t be, so I slow down. I raise my voice. Sometimes he listens. Sometimes he doesn’t. He’s only 7 after all.</p>
<p>So I’ve decided to remove this stress from my daily life. Gonna bite the bullet and buy myself an overpriced cargo bike and go all Danish on the situation. The reason it’s taken me this long is down to need. I haven’t really needed this until this week, but I imagine it will be a very important addition to the family. Ryan will no doubt learn to love going on rides for the fun of it. Not decided which one to go for yet but aim to have that resolved by the end of tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>These last few days have been exhausting. I decided to tackle the house in every single manner. When I began this process, I just knew that we had too much &lsquo;junk’ around us.  We certainly were not using everything and in a small little house, it all becomes more apparent as things tend to pile on top of each other. So I began the process of <em>Marie Kondo-ing</em> the house. Be ruthless, but remember to be kind to yourself throughout the process.</p>
<p>I have done this before but in a different time and place, during transition periods between country to country. This is the first time I review the situation within the confines of our lives as they exist now. For the most part, I was able to remove a large amount of things however there were a few things also coming in - either as necessary replacements or omissions that became clear after the clutter was removed.</p>
<p>While it might seem wasteful to dedicate such a large amount of my holiday time to sorting out our house this process actually frees my physical and mental space to focus on what is important. The greatest feeling I have had post this exercise has been the fact that there is now a specific place for everything. The joy of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place">Mise en place</a>, in a small family of four, is <em>liberating</em>. I highly recommend taking the time, no matter how much of a chore it feels like. Your future self will thank you for it.</p>

			 <p>📚 Just finished <em>Final Incal</em> by Alexandro Jodorowsky and José Ladrönn. It’s been a while since I dedicated some proper time to a graphic novel and this has been on my list for a while now since I bought it several years ago. Jodorowsky is one of my favourite writers in any medium. I would recommend the truly sublime <em>Son of the Gun</em> and <em>The White Lama</em> along with the epic <em>Saga of the Metabarons</em>.</p>
<p>What he is best known for however is <em>The Incal</em>. A mad space opera that set the foundation for a universe. I can see the reticence that Morbius had in returning to this world. Readers of the original series will  understand.</p>
<p>This series was fun and mad, but honestly it wasn’t as compelling as the other works I’ve mentioned, which set an incredibly high bar. I’d like to say it’s me, but honestly the dialogue didn’t flow for me. Ladrönn‘s artwork couldn’t capture the emotion of the characters. While the story flowed, it certainly doesn’t feel ‘final’ in any way. Many of these characters can and likely will return in new stories. I’d give this one a miss and rather go for the other series I’ve mentioned.</p>

We arrived and the place was shut. Zane was the first to really get upset. Gentle guy walking just behind us goes, &lsquo;Not to worry, go around the corner there is another excellent ice cream place.&rsquo; So we did. And it was excellent, had a few Nordic flavours I have never tried before (something that looked like Mango but wasn&rsquo;t). Definitely going to be returning.</p>

<ol>
<li>It was no where near as extravagant as I know the Japanese to be capable of. Not sure if this is by design or they were purposely held back by the you-know-what.</li>
<li>The highlight for me was the drones in the air and the pictogram montage (so much fun).</li>
<li>I can’t help but feel a little sad when I see countries represented by a tiny delegation.</li>
<li>By contrast there is huge pride in those tiny countries and managing to make it there.</li>
<li>The IOC can go fuck itself. This should have been a celebration of humanity. Rather it will be fine when it could have been spectacular. They could have and should have postponed it another year.</li>

			 <p>For the last year I have been trying to work out a ‘capture-configure-control’ setup. For those wondering what that is <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/04/20/the-productivity-funnel/">start here</a>. Newport recommends Trello, which I think is bloated. I tried using Basecamp, but I found the system offered friction I couldn’t overcome properly (it’s me not the software). Enter two plugins for Obsidian, that in tandem work together to focus my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban">Kanban</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-day-planner">Day Planner</a></li>
</ol>
<p>There is actually a third feature that I have found invaluable and that is the fact by default Obsidian allows you to fold lists. Capturing just became much easier and either move them into their own note or straight into the Kanban ready for action. Obsidian really has been a complete revelation in how mature, solid and versatile it is out the gate. I hope development continues on this app for many years to come.</p>

			 <p>I have been on a massive Elena Ferrante binge at the moment. Torn through the 2nd and 3rd Neapolitan Novels and straight onto the 4th. Tarantino’s special power is music. Khaled Hosseini makes you cry at the end of every one of his books.</p>
<p>In the 3rd book Ferrante made me cry at a scene that did not involve anything but two friends talking about her opinion of the others work. It was a masterful piece of writing and probably the strongest emotional hook I have read in years.</p>

			 <p>It took me a year and a half of working at home before I decided to invest <em>bigly</em> in a screen for my desk. Learning from my previous mistake of not buying the largest television screen available (some 6 years ago), I decided to go all out with my latest purchase, the AOC U32P2, a name that flows of the tongue I know. The real estate is incredible. I&rsquo;m reminded of this classic photo of Steve Jobs in his office. When I first saw it I thought, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t care much for everything in this office, but what an incredible size for a screen&rsquo;.</p>

			 <p>June is the first time that I missed publishing an issue of <em>In Abeyance</em> on time. Part of the reason is the fact that I don’t have a personal computer (save my iPhone). My MacBook died a couple of years ago. My iPad is getting fixed (or not depends on Apple at this stage). While the iPhone is great for capturing short thoughts (like this blog post), it’s a pretty poor experience for the longer form writing - screen is just too small. I have been looking at the AOC monitor for my home office. Combined with the <a href="https://www.shiftscreen.app">Shiftscreen</a> app, I could have avoided the delay in getting the newsletter out.</p>

			 <p>A little over a year after COVID began and things are beginning to open up here in Copenhagen. Of course they ‘opened’ a little earlier by means of testing regularly and a Coronapas - not going to lie, the whole process just did not appeal.</p>
<p>Being half vaccinated your mind can start doing something it couldn’t before. Making plans for the future. Some medium term and some longer term plans. Maybe go for a holiday? Maybe even get back onto a plane? Maybe get to see family again in the coming few months.</p>
<p>While I know I have lost many experiences this last year, at the same time I have gained much. More time with my kids. More time for the tempo of my body to slow down. More time for reflection. More time for boredom. More time for reading. More time for writing. More time for getting my ‘house’ in order.</p>
<p>I hope others were able to get something out of a world changing event that will be seared in our memories for many years to come.</p>

			 <p>📚<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781408898949">Humankind</a> by Rutger Bregman is probably the best book I have read in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is simply that it opened up a certain part of me that was yearning to come out. My optimistic side. I used to identify myself as an optimist, but slowly time beat that out of me as I became increasingly more cynical of the world and humanity around me. This view was somewhat amplified by any number of sources around me. News outlets. Friends. Family. Strangers. Life’s many experiences. A global pandemic.</p>
<p>What I needed was something uplifting. Something that could hopefully awaken the old me. Something that could help me work through and understand the injustices and terribleness that is so prevalent in our world today. The why is only the start of the process. The how can we change this for a better situation is far more interesting.</p>
<p>Will definitely be buying a paper copy of this book and run through some of the copious sources and counter arguments referenced throughout the book. If you are looking for something to present a different worldview than the one you likely have (which sometimes rubs you the wrong way because you want to believe in the alternative), then I highly recommend this book.</p>

I’m not going to say I will miss it. The <em>only</em> useful aspect of this technology for me is to see who has or hasn’t opened an email in a while. Truth is even then I haven’t used this feature to cull addresses.</p>
<p>I imagine that this then becomes an issue only as a newsletter grows. There will have to be new solutions adopted to address this. This could be as simple as a yearly poll that asks you to confirm you still want to receive the email, otherwise you will be removed. This might get annoying if everyone adopts the same technique (think that GDPR shitfest from a few years ago).</p>
<p>What people click on is even of less interest. I’m just just happy they found it engaging. I guess in the new world of newsletters, the only thing that matters is if someone signed up or removed themselves. If they sent you a response. Nobody ever seems to forward on an email so no need to worry about that.</p>

The other is good – peaceful, loving, modest, generous, honest, and trustworthy. These two wolves are also fighting within you, and inside every other person too.’<br>
After a moment, the boy asks, ‘Which wolf will win?’<br>

<p>Not sure how this happened, but apparently I have read on my kindle every single week for a little over a year now. This is the kind of metric tracking that I can really get behind - until a couple of weeks ago I had no idea this feature existed. Looking through the log, there were a couple of weeks where I read only once. In fact the 17 day streak is a far cry from my longest streak of 89 consecutive days. That is now clearly in my crosshairs.</p>

			 <p>It really is incredible what my parents had to go through when they moved to Greece in the 80s. Crucially they had to do it without Google translate and the internet. While they eventually got into the culture and feeling at home there it took time. Without a doubt the biggest barrier for entry however was the language.
Decades later I am going through the exact same barrier to entry here in Denmark. The spoken version of this language is incredibly foreign to me, bearing no resemblance to any of my other languages. This weekend was the first time it has affected me - couldn’t ride my bike because of a faulty lock. Turns out there was an alternative, if I knew how to read a handwritten note.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2021/05/20/micro-brand-watch-releases/">2 Micro Brand Watch Releases</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2021/05/20/micro-brand-watch-releases/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-05-20 09:16:00 -0500">May 20, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I dip my toes into the world of watches, I have decided to play around in the micro brand side of things and slowly move into more expensive options as I build my collection. There are two brands that seemingly have cornered this market as far as I’m concerned with their offerings are <a href="https://www.vaerwatches.com">Vaer</a> and <a href="https://www.sternglas.com">Sternglas</a>. What’s great about both is that they are not targeting the same styles, however they are approaching things in a very similar manner. One is based in the U.S and the other in Germany and both released a watch this week.</p>
<p>The interesting things relating to watch materials and colours are happening in the micro brand space. These new manufacturers do not have <em>heritage</em> to rely upon and so they have to provide a compelling reason to buy them over more established brands (that are likely to be here, 10, 20 years from now). These two brands don’t skimp on the specifications and have stayed true to their chosen design aesthetic.</p>
<h2 id="modesto">Modesto</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sternglas has <a href="https://www.sternglas.com/collections/all-watches/products/modesto-black">just released</a> the  <em>Modesto</em>, a very enticing watch with the option of a very simple black or white dial design. This naturally appeals to me on several levels, however if I think their very first idea, the <a href="https://www.sternglas.com/collections/naos-the-timepiece-2-0">Naos a better distillation</a> of what they are good at.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="d4">D4</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am definitely not on the market for another Vaer watch (considering I <em>just</em> got one a month ago), but this is a real beauty. The <a href="https://www.vaerwatches.com/collections/d4-usa-solar-diver">D4 is their entry model dive watch</a>. What I love about these dive watches is how the naming directly relates to their faces. I would have loved a <a href="https://www.vaerwatches.com/collections/dive-watches/products/d5-tropic-usa-diver">Tropic version</a> of the D4, however if I was to go for one of these D4s it would be the Atlantic version.</p>

<p>Now three years later I am edging closer and can finally share some of the very original ideas that got me excited so long ago. The very first book, the <em>Built Environment Compendium Vol.1</em> is complete and is now ready for <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/bec01">pre-ordering</a>.  I am still in conversations with my editor for final edits to the text, which should hopefully be done within the month.</p>
<p>This is the first time I use Gumroad and I am actually pretty excited to see what this platform has to offer to digital content creators. Overall I like the simplicity of the platform.</p>

I shared two quotes with Mike to frame what I hoped would be achieved through this process. The first is by Ryan Holiday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one creates flawless first drafts. And nobody creates better second drafts without the intervention of someone else. Nobody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is by Neil Gaiman:</p>

<p>Remember: when people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right.</p>

			 <p>It took a while but I finally reached an understanding of how to go about the self-publishing route. The truth of the matter is that one size <em>definitely</em> does not fit all. In this case my strategy seems like it will be split across 5 separate channels. What I also didn’t anticipate is the fact that the order in which each one is put online also plays an important role in all of this.</p>
<p>First and most importantly is to get your very own ISBN. Handily leaving in Denmark you are given the first 10 ISBNs for free. Not sure what happens after that (I think you just have to ask for more. For those looking to go down this wild route, here are a few key points that I have settled on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your own site.</strong> Digital goods can get sold on your own website using <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>. Simple and customisable. The percentage take is pretty reasonable for the convenience factor. I think Gumroad is a solid option for selling digital so that you can continue to create things that matter.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon / KDP.</strong> This is the big gorilla because it is the big player in this field. Go here first. Set things up accordingly so that they are pretty exclusive to Amazon themselves. Forget about Global Distribution. This is for those who want to buy things from Amazon and are hooked up into their ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Lulu.</strong> This is to offer a print alternative from your website. This is not for global distribution, rather simply to allow those internet savvy people that want a physical copy. They will have to go via the Lulu press website to finish off the transaction. The financial incentive to the seller is actually pretty low, however there is something truly magical about having your creation appear as a high quality physical object for a reasonable price. I have much more to</li>
<li><strong>Draft2Digital.</strong> This is for everyone not on Amazon. I can’t tell how big a market this is but it will include Apple.</li>
<li><strong>IngramSpark.</strong> This is for the global distribution to anywhere but Amazon or the internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each channel has a very distinct strength. None of them are ideal, but the beauty of it all is that they exist and someone with an idea and an iPad can put together their ideas into this world and offer it in a number of ways. My view is that I will begin to offer each of these distribution options in the sequence above. Launching them all on the same day is not possible but I don’t think it matters either as the work itself is not particularly topical, rather can be read now or in 5 years time.</p>

			 <p>I have been using Pages for iOS for the last year putting together several books and documents. In a word it been a <em>revalation</em>. Incredibly solid application that continues to put a smile on my face as I continue to use and be delighted by it. Working between my iPad and iPhone is seemless. From my part, I am extremely thankful to have such an application at my literal fingertips that has allowed me to create the book that I wanted. This first book is certainly not the last book that I intend to create using this application.</p>
<p>This year has brought a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207242">slew of additional features</a> which have been incredibly welcome. In my mind there is only one major feature that is surprisingly missing from such a complete package and that is the ability of creating an index. Sure you can create a table of contents automatically. You can style it to your hearts content, but the ability of highlighting a number of index points that get captured later is missing unfortunately. I do hope that Apple considers to add this feature - which has been requested across the place since 2009.</p>

Their customer support is atrocious. They don’t man the phones, don’t answer email. In fact I had to go via their Twitter account to get someone to respond to me. Truly awful.

Without planning, today is also the day I finally completed the work inside the book. The cover is <em>mostly</em> done  — there are still some small tweaks needed. There is still much work to be done before I can release it to the world, however that day is fast approaching.</p>
<p>This was a major project which included working out how to use Pages app on the iPad. I have been amazed at the completeness of features that Pages offers. The only missing feature has been creating an index.</p>

			 <p>In the spring of 2020, the world was going through unprecedented upheaval. Many across the world descended and depended heavily on the digital realm. It took a hold of our lives; our mental space was covered by a warm glowing digital blanket. Many of us embraced this new reality as we all tried to get away from the reality happening around us. We looked for escape. Years of conditioning took over, it could never have happened otherwise.</p>
<p>I was certainly not immune to this way of life. My attention was completely hijacked. Enough was enough. I confronted this new numbing reality. I consider how I wanted technology in my life. Rather than letting technology entertain me endlessly, through unlimited steams of content I would control how the digital realm would be allowed into my life. It was a difficult transition. A digital addict needs to step away from the things that have a hold over him.</p>
<p>At first I would leave my phone at home when I went out. I would take a notebook and a pen to try and make sense of the world around me. I looked to reading physical books again. I was transported back a decade, where these computers in our pockets did not exist. This was a slow, steady transition back to a more analogue world. The final piece of the analogue puzzle came when I looked down on my wrist. Empty and bare. I looked again and decided that it was <em>time</em> to finally get back to wearing a watch. That was when I fell face down into the rabbit hole.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://monday.micro.blog/2021/04/05/a-conversation-about.html">100th episode of the Micro Monday podcast is up</a>. Great overview of the short past and hopefully long future of the platform. I agree that getting all the things that currently exist in Micro.blog more refined and <em>faster</em> is the correct focus. The year of refinement.</p>
<p>The part I didn’t completely agree with was the suggestion by  Patrick to  add a tag into the profile. My site is random. Sure there are plenty of sites with a singular focus, most personal sites however do not fit this <em>limitation</em>. One, two or thirteen tags would not be enough or representative of my site - depends on how granular you want to get really. That is the charm and need of our digital gardens. We can plant anything we want in them.</p>
<p>So how do you make discovery better? That is a difficult one when everyone’s thoughts are so random. I think we need to move away from topics and concentrate our efforts elsewhere. Maybe the reasons to discover anyone should be more about <em>tone</em> than topic. How you quantify this tone is a tricky question to answer. I do think that understanding how often someone publishes is key to this equation as well.</p>

			 <p>The year of learning continues - at least in so much as I can see what the next thing that I want to learn. Last week I ventured into the world of juggling. While I’m not ready to join the circus yet, I am actually capable of juggling 3 objects, a skill I have wondered about for years. YouTube is an exceptional platform for learning as it connects you to a world of teachers. For juggling I learnt from <a href="https://m.youtube.com/c/TaylorTries/videos?disable_polymer=true&amp;itct=CBQQ8JMBGAEiEwiho5OtydPvAhUEwk8IHQ8vAgs%3D&amp;disable_polymer=true&amp;rootVe=3611&amp;disable_polymer=true&amp;rootVe=3611&amp;disable_polymer=true&amp;rootVe=3611">Taylor Tries</a>.</p>
<p>Next up I’m thinking of diving into learning the piano  and maybe teaching Zane as well. The piano is an instrument I gave up on over 25 years ago. I do have some mental scars from my piano teacher but I’m hoping that my current self can overcome these. First is getting a piano, but it seems that the one to go for is either the Yamaha P45 or the Roland FP10.</p>

What extraction method did you use; pour over, Aeropress, moka pot, other? What method did you use? How many grams did you use? Stacked and in concert it <em>totally</em> changes the outcome.</p>

			 <p>It strikes me as odd that we have not considered where things are meant to go after they have served their purpose with us. They don’t necessarily need to be old and broken to have exhausted their usefulness, rather they were important to us at one point that we brought them into our lives and now they are not. Mostly things get discarded and thrown into landfills or burned. From a manufacturer level there should be a clear understanding as to how the story ends for each item we buy.</p>

			 <h2 id="chapter-01">Chapter 01</h2>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We all need a system that aims to reduce the noise and clutter that manifests in our lives, be it physical, digital or mental. We all have a great deal on our minds. We have too much stuff. We all need a better system than the one we’re currently using. Fundamentally, the issue with humans is that we are natural hoarders. Although it seems to takes considerably <em>less</em> amount of effort in accumulating as it does to discard. We seem to have more difficulty letting go. To reduce our mental overhead, the journey begins by defining those elements that are <em>essential</em>. This is then followed by carefully assessing what can be considered <em>enough</em> to our overall <em>wellbeing</em>, with as little <em>excess</em> as possible.</p>
<p>Any system seeking to define a universal approach to life is going to fall far short for all people. When it’s too broad it becomes harder to tailor to everyone’s unique situation. I’m a teacher. I’m a father. I’m an Engineer. I’m a mother. The intent in this sporadic series of articles is to try and find a common an implementable school of thought, such that anyone can gain something of use and merit.</p>
<p>Once you are able to see the elements of your life for what they truly are and what they actually mean to you, then you can decide on what to do with them. The challenge with the things that we all collect is that their status in our lives shifts in importance the longer they stay with us. They also shift in importance depending on where in your life they appear. Being able to understand these shifts and react to them is an essential skill that needs to be developed in all of us.</p>
<p>Our lives are complex, with a number of moving parts that are all competing with each other for attention and oftentimes supremacy. As we <em>carry</em> these parts around with us, they occupy physical, conscious or subconscious space. The issue being that each one of these parts contributes overall to our mental overhead. Becoming aware of these parts, then being able to categorise them and place them, first into main categories and then into smaller compartments. Once these categories and their compartments are clearly defined, managing them is the next step. Once you understand the pieces in a defined format, the enormity of the task becomes ever more apparent.</p>
<p>Why is this even important? Why change the way you are doing things? Being able to reduce and understand will give you agency. Agency over the world around you. Agency over your belongings (be they physical, digital or mental) that oftentimes you are beholden to. Many (most?) of us where never give clear direction on how to manage these pieces. They were just given to us and we were tasked with understanding and managing them. They called it experience. They called it life lessons. While much of this is true there has to be a better way. Others have tried in part to address this, but there are flaws in their systems. The flaw is trying to distill everything into something you can hold in the palm of your hand. Something simple. Most importantly something that can reduce your mental overhead. You need sensible defaults.</p>

			 <p>While it may seem that I am on a mission to collect <em>all</em> the iOS text apps, <a href="http://giddyapp.io/index.html">Quick Draft</a> by giddyapp is an excellent addition. This is the spiritual replacement for the Edit app. It links the text across your iCloud account (including your Mac). Has some basic, but elegant, markdown formatting. I’m using it to dump any idea or thought that comes into my head. Surprisingly there is a lot of randomness in the file. Intention is to clean it up at the end of the day into more permanent places.</p>

			 <p>One of the things that I have learnt much later on in my life is the power of iteration. When I was younger I would look on in wonder at what others had accomplished. What I failed to understand is that by merely starting and allowing yourself the time to iterate and build upon the foundation that you have built will allow you go to get to something infinitely more complex than if you tried to condense the process. Your <em>taste</em> exceeds your skill at this stage. That is ok. Keep at it by iterating often, don’t get frustrated. If you keep at it, one day your skills and taste will meet.</p>

			 <p>I’m sure this was on Ngoc’s list for a while however by chance I dropped him an email a few days ago asking for the opportunity to use my beloved <em>Merriweather</em>. He said it was coming in the latest iteration of 1writer - which just dropped. One of the new features is being able to pick any of your installed fonts. Oh and he also mentioned that he is hard at work on version 4. Super excited about that.</p>

			 <p>I get it now. Yesterday after having discovered the recently added broadcast feature for Goodnotes, I stumbled across a video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHheJCVYahw">Craft app</a>. I really wasn’t looking for another note taking app (I promise) — yet I quickly realised where this could fit in perfectly. Research.</p>
<p>The main reason I think this works, is because Craft isn’t a pure text editor. It will happily collect pdfs and images and format links with thumbnails, in a manner that is less bloated than something like Evernote. For years I have tried using Pinboard as a way to collect all my research, but it doesn’t fully fit into my workflow. Having one document which I use to dump things into during a month of writing is a pretty powerful way to collect all these thoughts. Exceptional polish for such a young application and I can certainly see why it has gotten the attention it has. It is different to Obsidian, Roam and that is ok, you cannot have one text editor to rule them all.</p>
<p>The biggest ding against it however is <a href="https://www.craft.do/pricing">the pricing</a>. At $45/year, the question is whether I feel strongly enough about keeping everything <em>within</em> the app itself. The app makes it easy to export an .md file along with all the attachments. Honestly this limitation might actually be a blessing considering it forces me to keep everything pruned - although I will probably only need to do this around the 10-15 document limit.</p>

			 <p>This post from Arun about <a href="https://www.arun.is/blog/desk-setup/">the Art of the Desk Setup</a> is pretty inspiring. Following this I took a hard look at my desk setup and realised there are wins that I could be making in the short and medium term. While I note that Arun doesn’t have any notebooks or pens on his desk (that would just not fly on my desk), I really love the sheer size of his screen (something I am looking to replicate), the cable management system under his desk is great and digital dock are ideas I hadn’t considered previously.</p>

			 <p>I will say that Jason Snell’s hunt for the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/">perfect iOS Markdown writing tool</a> is a fools errand. I should know, I have been on this very same hunt for years. The difference is that I have <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2020/10/13/typed-writing-modes.html">realised that there is no single tool to rule them all</a>. Rather what we are truly blessed with is a incredible ecosystem of applications with their very own strength.</p>
<p>I actually removed Simplenote from my setup and so my text is focused across Drafts (Micro.blog and now Twitter), iA Writer (long form writing) and my Zettelkasten. I do feel there is room for an Obsedian-like application for iOS that caters to the Zettelkasten crowd — 1Writer is great but could be soo much better, except development is seemingly very slow.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/044">Issue 044</a> of my newsletter <em>In Abeyance</em> is out.This issue focuses on the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, architectural practice Snøhetta and urban maps.</p>
<p>With this issue I am reverting back to my monthly schedule again in releasing the newsletter. Part of the struggle I have had is that I actually enjoy the researching and writing something that is a little longer form than what the bi-monthly schedule allowed.</p>
<p>I have decided to use Twitter in a different manner than I have previously. The idea is to share links, videos, images of the research that goes into each and every issue, as I am writing the issue. I’ll also be collecting these against a hashtag that is not being widely used. This means that in the future after you have read a specific issue you can jump onto the Twitter hashtag as a companion stream that allows you explore a topic in a different way that my 1500 word essays do.</p>

<p>I keep coming back to this quote from Seth Godin:</p>

The word stops and even though you have heard this song what feels like a million times, the timing, the joy of the moment, the sun outside, it breaks the barrier and you find yourselves singing it.

			 <p>I always <em>knew</em> there was an entire universe surrounding coffee. A bunch of coffee nerds talking about grind, water quality, grams per litre, percolation, pour over. You needed to have all the gear to make something half decent. You needed beans (sustainably sourced) from Guatemala. And on and on.</p>
<p>Honestly, you can go as deep as you want, like with anything attached to any <em>industry</em>. I’ve had a reasonably varied relationship with my coffee. This year however is when I take it up a little notch. No, not going to be buying an espresso machine any time soon, but will be building  my coffee making collection purposefully.</p>
<p>I have been using the v60 almost exclusively over the last year to make pour over filter coffee. The first enhancement has been the introduction of a small kitchen scale and a Bodum milk frother. Its a surprising purchase that actually makes a decent milky based coffee at home. I am going to be (re)buying an Aeropress next (I lost the filter a while back and never bothered to replace it). One of the coffee nerds guiding me on this journey is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ">James Hoffmann</a>. Definitely recommend his videos on the subject. Suitably snooty about what he is doing, but actually comes from a factual and scientific angle.</p>

			 <p>📚 <em>The Spy Who came in from the Cold</em> by John Le Carré is the first book of 2021. Excellent novel, certainly worthy of your attention. Recommendation came from Ben Rhodes on the <em>Pod Save The World</em> podcast. I guess I totally missed this but Le Carré died a little over a month ago. Fitting tribute by reading the mans best. Although thinking about reading <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</em> next.</p>

			 <p>Been looking for some easy wins for the morning. These five <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=08MTATIFaPg">overnight oats recipes</a> have been a real winner for me. The trick to overnight oats it seems is making sure that you put the same amount of oats to liquid and then add half as much yogurt. The end result has been awesomely smooth and creamy. I have previously been eyeballing it. Big mistake. Getting the measurements right is actually super important.</p>

			 <p>Time seriously flies by. Today marks three (!) years on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. The last year being the most I have posted to any website ever within a year. 1700 posts later, I absolutely love the service that has gone from strength to strength. My interaction changed from the middle of last year, but that was part of a digital detox that I have maintained (after a fashion). I certain miss some of the interactions, but for the time being this distance works for me a little. Maybe this year I bring back some of the interactions back, in a controlled way.</p>
<p>As is customary for me, my yearly pitch about the excellence of Micro.blog. I’ll use one of my favourite quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You ask what is the proper limit to a person&rsquo;s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.”<br>
— Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as Micro.blog is concerned, it gives you what is essential and then what is enough.</p>

			 <p>Naturally, living in the upper northern hemisphere, the winter offers a unique challenge for us. Grey skies. Cold weather. Limited sunlight. The middle of January is starting to feel like we are slowly creeping away from the exceedingly long nights. Sure there is much better days to come, but at least you can see light by 7:30am and there is still light after 4:30pm. Its funny how you can take a lot for granted until it is taken away from you. Equally, experiencing all four seasons has been spectacular. Can’t have it all.</p>

			 <p>On a personal level, nothing that happens in American politics has any direct effect on my life. Not <em>really</em>. It’s no different than what happens in Australian or Russian politics. In fact what happens in Belgium or Germany is likely more important to my life and I certainly don’t pay them any attention.</p>
<p>I have a bipolar relationship with America. I consume a lot of <em>culture</em> that is produced there (from books, to shows, to music, to software, to electronics). I mean the ultimate endorsement is that my wife is half American. Yet I certainly don’t believe in the rhetoric and I can see many of the social issues that the country has to manage (systemic racism, rampant gun control, undemocratic electoral system, etc).</p>
<p>One of the best books I’ve read about America’s future is called <em>Fall of the Empire</em>. Its not talking about the British one, that fell long ago. No this was published over a decade ago by the same guy how predicted the fall of the USSR, then at the peak of its power and the reasons why, back in the 70s. In this book he described the reasons for the fall of the American Empire. Many of the topics he covers were played out yesterday.</p>
<p>So why am I glued to watching what is happening? Part of it might be that its a well documented car crash. This week has shown just how much of a sham the whole system is. Sure you might argue that the system will get rid of the bad players eventually, proof that there are <em>some</em> checks and balances. The thing is I want to try and remember when an angry mob stormed another parliament building in a first world country? Seriously. The fact that it got this far shows how poor the system in place is. Hell, even countries like Lebanon, with governments soo incompetent they kept a nuclear bomb in the center of the city for over 10 years, is able to control it’s population from entering the parliament building.</p>
<p>More broadly however I think from an early age I realised that the American machine touched many of our lives but in an indirect way. <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/issues/democracies-decline">Democracy is in decline</a>. I am someone raised in a democracy and enjoy the freedoms that comes with that. I certainly don’t want to swear allegiance to any ‘dear leader’ nor do I want to operate under the watchful eye of a ‘party’, communist or otherwise. I believe in democracy.</p>

			 <p>Having released a number of projects in 2019 (it was after all the <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/release">year of release</a>), the focus of 2020 was the year of consolidation. The intent was to focus my mind on these projects and make them <em>better</em> - implicit was the fact that I was not to add any new projects.</p>
<p>What I didn’t expect was that in 2020, I would also start my personal learning journey.</p>
<ol>
<li>I learnt how to draw trees, which really laid the foundation for my artwork to take a step forward.</li>
<li>I had never made sweet potato buns, now these have become a regular staple in the house and have seriously elevated my burger-fu. I have become ever better at making eggs in a number of ways (omelettes were conquered early on, but now boiled and Korean-style egg sandwiches are normal for us).</li>
<li>I finally understood how to make a better cup of coffee (I was 80% of the way there, that last 20% really makes all the difference).</li>
<li>I dove deeper than I care to admitt into the world of watches, which I hope to expand upon one a year until I have my collection where I want it to be.</li>
<li>I spent hours working out my clothing style (and working out where to buy what), which I hope will come together more in 2021.</li>
<li>I discovered digital minimalism and time block planning. I still suck at both, but at least I know what I need to do.</li>
<li>I finally consolidated my notes into a Zettelkasten built around Obsidian and 1Writer.</li>
<li>I was able to loose about 10kg using the No-S diet. I fell off the wagon a little bit in the last few months (mainly due to work pressures and just being a little bit mentally exhausted).</li>
</ol>
<p>For 2021, the year of learning I want <em>more</em> of the above. I’m not sure what exactly I want to learn specifically, but I know that I really have enjoyed the process of getting better personally at certain things and understanding the reasons why.</p>

			 <p>The last few months have been a bit of a whirlwind for my newsletter. I felt like I was not giving myself the necessary time to let ideas percolate. Rather once I had settled on the idea, the writing process felt a little <em>hurried</em>.</p>
<p>Following on from the release of the latest issue, I sat down and mapped out all of next year’s issues, at least in principal. Surprisingly I am only revisiting 5 topics discussed in the previous 2 volumes. I think it is important that I review some of these topics from time to time if I feel that there is more to discuss. I’m sure new and wonderful ideas will bubble up throughout the year but in this way I hope to have a place to throw ideas and links into the document over a period of time. Takes a little bit of the friction from starting to write an idea.</p>

			 <p>For 2½ years I have been working on <a href="https://www.stet.build/ia">Stet.Build</a>. It has been some of the most enjoyable work I have done in that time and aim to continue writing it for years to come. Lately I have started to wonder why it isn’t receiving traction with more readers.</p>
<p>The truth is I have tried a few things on LinkedIn but Twitter is where those most likely to engage with the articles hang out online. I have never had a good relationship with the platform but I have recognised that it is what it is. So I will be spending the next few months trying to build over there. What I will be posting over there is considerably different to what I post here on my site. It has been an interesting few days and my mind is switching into this mode a little bit.</p>
<p>There is actually a lot of excellent information and people posting on there in the science ans engineering sphere. Already got two new ideas for future articles and I&rsquo;ve only been on there for a few days. The main issue is that the information is desperately dispersed. Building up my lists of accoubts to follow has been the hardest part of this process - my reasoning is that once this is set it will be a matter of managing and pruning.</p>

			 <p>Diving into <em>print on demand</em> publishing, ISBN numbers, Ingramspark, KDP, Lulu and everything in between has been overwhelming.</p>
<p>Selling something online is very easy. The fact that there are options available to tap into all these markets is amazing. Going digital is the smart way to go.</p>
<p>My main issue however is that I have gotten properly excited about the physical object in front of me. I’d like to offer this option to others but not sure the smartest route. Ingramspark can get you into the building, if you take some risk (offer a high discount and allow returns).  Lulu royalties make the exercise nearly worthless (0.79 cents for a $15 is a joke). Not a real fan of any of these options.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Following on my original statement about print quality from Lulu, I can confirm that the overall quality of the trade books with the high quality paper is truly <em>excellent</em>.</p>
<p>I printed the book both with the higher end printing process and the standard printing process and found the difference unnoticeable. I had to go check that I had indeed ordered two different books. I think for something like the <em>BEC</em>, the standard printing is going to be an excellent option that has a good balance between the cost and quality.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> element that I wish was available is having french flaps - although don’t think that many POD services offer this option. The soft matt cover however is excellent. If you have any hesitation about going down the Lulu printing for this type of book, put those worries to ease.</p>

<p>This is going to take a little time I see to get him to start his night off in his bed and hopefully stay there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/040">Issue 040</a> of my email newsletter, <em>In Abeyance</em> is now out.</p>
<p>Always feels good to get an issue done. Most times I have no idea what I am going to write about until a week before it needs to go out and there is some frantic searching and banging my head against the wall for a few days. I <em>might</em> even get a little grumpy. This is the 23rd issue of the year and what a year it has been. Next issue is the last for the year.</p>
<p>From my introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a child one of my deepest fears was that of loosing my eyesight. Something about living such a life filled me first with sorrow and dread. With age that point of view transformed into admiration and respect.
Throughout my life I have not had any real interaction with anyone that is visually impaired or blind. One of the only real interaction that I have had is those elements present in the built environment meant to cater to the blind.
These elements have become more noticeable to me since moving to Copenhagen last year and were the clear inspiration for this week’s issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are curious about the built environment I <a href="https://www.stet.build/signup">urge you to sign up</a>, best email on the subject you will get roughly published every two weeks — I’m trying to resolve my publishing schedule so that I can get rid of the roughly part of that sentence.</p>

Around May time when things started kicking off at work properly and I read <em>Digital Minimalism</em> that allowed me to regain my attention which was hijacked by the internet. I fall back into some old habits on occasion, but this is definitely less common these days than a year ago.</p>

			 <h1 id="story-exploder">Story Exploder</h1>
<p>This is now becoming a bit of a tradition on this site. During the month of November I will take my hand at a little bit of short fiction that I make up on a daily basis. This breaks every rule I have for writing. Not knowing what the story is ultimately about and where it is heading is both scary and foreign to me - which is why I insist on doing it. It puts my brain in a mode that I am not used to. It stretches it.</p>
<p>This year was exceptionally hard for me. I came close to giving up a few times around the half way mark which I think is the hardest part of the story. The first 10 instalments are about building the world, the middle 10 instalments are about giving the characters something to do. The last 10 instalments are about bringing it all together.</p>
<p>The prompts are interesting for me in that they help get things kicked off at the start. Even though they are a single word in 50 they do play an important role. When I know where the story is meant to be heading is when I drop them. This year I used them all the way up to day 25 (shows how completely lost I felt this year).</p>
<p>The final story (and title) will be published next week after I have had a few days to let it all sink in. I can get the editing machete to the whole body of text, fine tuning and pruning it into something more coherent. What’s currently published on the site is the first draft. We all know that mostly these are&hellip;<em>raw</em>.</p>
<p>Plan is now to go back to writing about randomness that I have actually missed this last month and a half.</p>

As I stared outside I wondered how many others had made the switch back. Was I alone in the world? The communicator remained silent for what seemed like forever. I tried to add to the silence. I tried again and again. Then after trying for what seemed like an eternity, ever so faintly, apprehensively even, I heard the words, ‘Hello. World?’</p>

I switched back. Silence. Inside the alert module was not exploding around me, the communications were not responding. Outside was even more disconcerting. Rather than the regular barrage I was greeted with a soft glow from the horizon. For the first time in centuries a human being could see the sun rising.</p>

Humanity had reached its zenith and had succeeded in destroying itself. We couldn’t talk, plead or engineer ourselves out of the situation. In these moments our imagination and creativity did not count for much. As the most destructive species on the planet it was hardly a surprise that our final act would be unto ourselves.</p>

<p>At first the plan looked to be working.

Our joy was short lived and in what seemed like an instant, we were overwhelmed.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This years short story has been an interesting exercise of something not quiet going my way, until I remembered what made last year’s attempt work for me. This year I was focusing on the individual 50 word instalments. Last year I was writing the story in one big file. I would go back and modify, tweak, edit. With four more instalments to go, I went back and did a number of heavy edits to the story.</p>
<p>I don’t ever intend to participate in Nanowrimo, however this single-1500-word-story-per-year exercises a writing muscle I don’t typically get to use very often. While the process can be frustrating at times (I still have no idea how the story is going to end on Monday), coming up with the actual story, building on it and trying to <em>stick the landing</em> is worth trying once a year.</p>

What we also noticed was that after someone did manage to return from the Spectrum, this came with an extended period of tranquility. By sending everyone into the Spectrum at once the hope was that this would overwhelm the system and allow as many to return as possible.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since I read <em>Digital Minimalism</em> earlier this year, I have been on a bit of a journey into more purposeful productivity methods, which can be attributed to a couple of reasons - the work itself and the place of work.</p>
<p>I have been listening to Cal Newport talk about Time Blocking for months now, but not really been able to implement it because there was another piece of the puzzle that was not available to me, the configure part of his method. This week I was finally able to find the solution to the configure section of things.</p>
<p>He would alway suggest using Trello and I did honestly try a couple of times. Turns out the man is very smart but his blind spot is Trello (we all have one). This overtly complicated software with fiddly (and silly) options, themes, templates, bloat. Just terrible advice really.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="https://www.trackteamtime.com">TeamTime</a>.</p>
<p>Two apps that work together to complete the configure circle. While it may seem limited at first, the free Basecamp Tier is incredibly versatile, because you can have an infinite amount of individually named todo lists.</p>
<p>Basecamp gives you three ‘projects’. I would offer you to think of these as contexts instead. I have three contexts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Internal</li>
<li>External</li>
</ol>
<p>Within each context I then have multiple projects, each with its own todo list. What is great about the Todo lists for Basecamp is that each todo list can have a general discussion attached to it, each item can have a general discussion attached to it. I can add files if I want, but I tend not to (usually adding links to files instead).</p>
<p>Under personal I have also added categories such as housework, to get a general feel for how much time I actually spend on household tasks. Eventually I will also add how much time I spend on walking, reading and writing.</p>
<p>At work the external context gets the most action, however increasingly more time is spent elsewhere. I needed an ever more accurate way of tracking the plethora of channels so that I don’t context switch and keep that to a minimum. I think I finally found it as long as the free tiers remain.</p>

‘Your memory might be young, Lieutenant Luciana, but your actions mask the fact that you are the most prolific skyminder we have ever had. Humanity is tired Luciana. Over the decades we have tried to break free of the endless cycle.’ The Admiral paused and looked intently at Luciana.</p>

			 <p>It’s been 2 weeks of writing my story in roughly 50 word chunks. This is part of the Micro.blog November challenge. I decided last year to combine this challenge and NaNoWriMo into one, which yielded a <a href="www.kaa.bz/themark">short story</a> called <em>The Mark</em>. What I liked about the exercise is that it had very low stakes and expectations. Sometimes it’s all about the journey and not the destination.</p>

‘The decision to put the fate of humanity in the hands of our children was not taken lightly.

On the table was a decanter and two large wine glasses. Luciana took her seat at the table. ‘15 years old’, began the old lady ‘is that the average life expectancy of a skyminder.

The eyes belonged to an old lady who was looking down with focused intention. She wore a sharp two piece navy blue skirt and jacket.  The only tell that she was military was a sharp silver pin under her left shoulder. ‘Sorry about the abrupt interuption, we have much to get through.’ Luciana slowly managed to get to her feet, before she could say anything they were both inside a large empty tent with a round table and two chairs in the center.</p>

<p>Speaking to my guy in the know he rightly predicted that a November ‘present’ would be coming. 16” and 13” MacBook Pro first, followed by the Air. His other prediction was that the new lineup will be slightly cheaper than the current lineup of MacBooks.</p>

The puzzling was distinct in that you were always doing the chasing. This was a direct contrast to the realities of being a skyminder. This mental construct also served as a training ground, to help you anticipate how a chaser moves, thinks and reacts. Luciana was bounding through a city made of infinitely routes across seemingly infinite levels. In an instant she found herself knocked to the ground by an impossible force.</p>

			 <p><strong>7 of 30 / Inflate</strong><br>
The human subconscious needs to be fed challenges. It is what keeps the brain from imploding in on itself. The puzzling was created to offer just the right level of engagement. A near infinite maze of challenges to explore and discover. The levels of complexity continuously inflate as more time is spent wandering the conjured worlds. Some skyminders have spent their entire lives between these two states of being.</p>

In the suspended state your mind wanders; meanders. While your physical body floats in the air, suspended on an invisible stoop. Everything lingers.

Your subconscious however is in complete overdrive.</p>

Although confined to an aerial bunker, there was an ever present view of the world outside. Seasons had long since disappeared, replaced instead by an endless cornucopia of states. Each state brought with it a different colour to the sky. No longer confined to vibrant blues or dreary grey skies, the world now offered an always changing spectrum. There might have been a time when this display might have even been considered beautiful to behold. Instead this change meant a constant state of alert.</p>

			 <p>Today I went to the supermarket briefly. Its not the major weekly shop, as we get that delivered to the house, rather this is for quick essentials we’ve run out of.</p>
<p>For the first time since this pandemic began I felt safe as a new sign was put on the door for everyone entering to wear a mask. When we are all doing it it just feels like we are helping keep each other safe. It is a simple precaution.</p>
<p>Is it annoying? Absolutely. Does it matter? Absolutely.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this year I semi stepped away from the Micro.blog community. It certainly wasn’t anything the community did to me. The truth is I enjoyed many of the interactions and the people I ‘met’ on the platform. The problem was that I didn’t like how <em>I</em> was using the service as a crutch for boredom.</p>
<p>This is a service that doesn’t really gain much from me constantly checking it. There are no advertisers involved, and yet I found myself checking the feed. Maybe it was a muscle memory, built across a decade that will be hard to break after a few short months? So as part of my digital detox I cut everything out.</p>
<p>A little while later I thought I could be an adult about this and decided to try and introduce it back into my life. Sadly, I found I was falling into the same trap as before.</p>
<hr>
<p>I love the service for my hosting and the near limitless ways of publishing. It works perfectly for me. In fact this year I am going the full premium. I don’t like it for reading. So what to do? I created a new tag in Feedbin. Slowly I am pushing everyone’s feeds in there and now i have a dedicated place that I can go and access in a more purposeful manner.</p>
<p>What is missing is the interaction. I wish there was a way to interact with these posts directly from Feedbin, or at least be able to go to the site and somehow leave a comment. My comments made to a post in Micro.blog is then displayed on a persons website. I don’t know what the easy way to leave a comment on a persons website is.</p>

Nearly 2 years into this newsletter and I continue to experiment with the exact form it should take.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Spent some time sorting out through my various text editors and how I want to organise my typed words. Taking inspiration from the system for my notebook, once again I realised that a single app for all the different threads and channels is foolish. By dedicating an app for a specific task, you are signaling to yourself that this is what I want to get done right now. This is where this type of work lives. Also different apps have different strengths - play to their strengths.</p>
<h2 id="drafts">Drafts</h2>
<p>This is where all my blogging happens. The direct publishing to Micro.blog is exactly what I want. I open the app and can get writing straight away. If I want to have something with a title, it’s also there. No constraints or worrying about length. Just type and publish.</p>
<p>I set this up with two specific managed workspaces. Default is unpublished and therefore publishing ideas. The second is just an archive of everything that I have written and published.</p>
<h2 id="ia-writer">iA Writer</h2>
<p>This is where the projects live. I have synced this up with iCloud. I have individual folders for each project and so when its time to work on any on project I know where to go.</p>
<h2 id="1writer--obsidian--software-agnostic">1Writer / Obsidian / Software Agnostic</h2>
<p>Finally this all clicked for me. This is my second brain. Using the Zettlekasten method, I am able to start collecting and writing information knowing that it is a single folder of text files. Lives on Dropbox and honestly I can’t wait to have hundreds of thousands of notes in there. The more the better as long as they are tagged and interlinked with each other</p>
<h2 id="simplenote">Simplenote</h2>
<p>I decided to also add Simplenote to the mix. This is really just a place to brain dump. Sometimes I like to work something out. It doesn’t really fit into any of the above modes. Sometimes its clearing out junk from my head, when I don’t want to write things down, I want to type them out. Its not a major part of my routine, but I have found that these random text files find their way into different places. Why not create a dedicated space for this. I have called this my Brain Cleanser.</p>

<p>Its taken a really long time but I have finally settled on my physical notebook situation that I use on a regular basis. I originally was trying to fit everything into a single book, a Hobonichi. Foolishness. No instead, what I actually needed was 5 distinct notebooks, plus a bunch of little pocket notebooks. Lets unpack that.</p>
<h2 id="1--the-sketchbook">1 / The Sketchbook</h2>
<p>I wish I had stumbled across this concept earlier in my life. Keep a sketchbook for exploration. Use one notebook and fill it with all the sketches, rough, finished, try different mediums, give yourself room to explore. What you might find in those pages is your style moving; shifting; growing. A visual playground of your own creation. What’s interesting about this is the first few pages are going to be poor even to your eyes. Don’t feel discouraged. Persevere and you will see yourself slowly but surely getting better.</p>
<p>My notebook of choice for this type of notebook is a blank A5 Midori MD.</p>
<h2 id="2--the-journal">2 / The Journal</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your thoughts are like water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now in my 5th year of regular journalling I don’t do this as often as I want (twice a day), but I have been carving some time out every day to go through it. This is your mental dumping ground. This is where you letter your mind write whatever it wants. The paper is not going to judge you. Better for you to write it down than let it float and bounce around your head.</p>
<p>For this, I have settled on the excellent sized <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/cafe-note-b6-slim-grid.html">B6 Cafe Note</a> from Nanami paper. I’ve got a Gfeller cover that will last me years and years to come.</p>
<h2 id="3--the-writer">3 / The Writer</h2>
<p>Turns out the best way to write articles, books or anything is to get it onto paper first. While my online writing can be captured pretty quickly in Drafts or iA Writer, when I want to work something out, the sequence of thoughts and ideas, there is nothing better than paper. For stringing these thoughts into cohesive sentences I go digital, but for working things out, I go analogue.</p>
<p>Although I am currently using some Muji A5 notebooks, I have a massive <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html">Seven Seas Nanami notebook</a> waiting to be used just for this purpose. Once my current notebook is finished (probably end of the year), can shift over to the book that will last me a whole lot longer.</p>
<h2 id="4--5--meeting-notes--taskmanager">4 &amp; 5 / Meeting Notes &amp; Taskmanager</h2>
<p>For years I employed the bullet journal method to get shit done at work. It was invaluable to me. However one of the issues is we live in an increasingly digital world and there are far to many channels. I found myself breaking the mould and away from some of the basic things that make the system useful (put the date at the top, collection of tasks for a topic, bullets for notes). It was all getting messy again. I also found the A5 notebook wasn’t getting filled out very well.</p>
<p>So I decided to split things a little. I have two A6 notebooks. One dedicated for just notes, ideas, whatever. The other is just to capture all of my actions into individual buckets. Every page is a channel. Whenever a task pops up I put it into one of the channels</p>
<p>My go to are the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2021/pc/detail_toolstoys/tt_ob19_note/">Hobonichi A6</a> notebooks. Blank and beautiful. No eccentric Japanese quotes or sketches of foxes or whatever else they have added recently to the Techo. I know this is probably part of the charm, but to be honest, I want that 20% lost paper per page to be mine.</p>
<h2 id="6--pocket-notebooks">6 / Pocket Notebooks</h2>
<p>Finally I have been using pocket notebooks for over a decade. These go with me wherever I go. Its a practice that has served me well and even if it’s one note, its one note less bouncing in your head or worse, lost forever. I hate that.</p>

			 <p>One of my many flaws, and one that I have struggled with the most, is my general nature to maintain my stuff like new. Its a character trait that I fully inherited from my mother. We get upset when something gets a scratch, or a tear or a dent. Sadly I see that this trait has been passed onto my eldest. I know how heartbreaking it feels when something you cherish breaks somehow but I also recognise that this is not the way of the world. So when Zane had a moment of recent madness over a tear in one of his drawings, I decided to explain the beauty and acceptance of Wabi-sabi. It helped that I had the perfect prop to explain it to him.</p>
<p>When he couldn’t have been more than a few years old he took a liking to my navy blue Kaweco fountain pen. Coming home one day I saw that he had totally done a number on all the edges as he frantically was trying to use it as marking tool. At the time I was super upset as Kaweco had stopped making pens in this rich blue colour. I now look at the pen and it reminds of a curious 2 year old and all the times it would write all over the house with anything he found. Every ‘flaw’ tells a story which becomes even more important than the object itself. Surprisingly it didn’t take him very long to start looking for wabi-sabi in all his own posessions.</p>

			 <p>Two things that were reinforced today about something you create. The first is that the best ‘marketing’ you can hope to achieve is creating something worthwhile. Creating something people care about and find value in. The second thing is that any form of success can take a long while to achieve. Don’t despair. The road is long.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since around 2007, nearly 12 years, I have relied on a Mac to get me through my projects. During that time I have used a Mac Mini and two 13” MacBook Pros. They are machines that have served me very well during these times. Last year I had the first motherboard problem on any machine I have owned. To be honest it was 6 years old at this stage and had taken a considerable beating being in a household with young children.</p>
<p>Luckily I had invested a year earlier in an iPad Pro, in the hope of one day relying upon it as my portable device and hopefully getting an iMac for the desk. For the most part that plan is still on track as I have found my iPad to be more than capable for 80% of the tasks that I want to get done. My biggest limitation being the reasonably poor front end web development tools available on the iPad. The most glaring omission being the lack of a web inspector backed into any of the browsers.</p>
<p>Another reason I opted not to buy a replacement was that I was waiting for an update to the infamous keyboard. This came relatively quickly along with news of new Apple silicon towards the end of the year. While others may have just bit the bullet and gotten a replacement, these are COVID times and my iPad Pro was perfectly capable of handling <em>most</em> of my computing needs, something it was even much better than a MacBook.</p>
<p>The experience wasn’t rosey the whole year. For weeks I was plagued with poor bluetooth connectivity to the keyboard. It just made for a frustrating experience. The killer blow to me was a little over a month ago. I upgraded to 13.6 and ran into a battery drain bug for my iPad which actually derailed my production for several weeks as I spent far too long trying to resolve it.</p>
<p>It remains unresolved.</p>
<p>I jumped into iOS 14 Beta in the hopes that this will go away. It didn’t.</p>
<p>Tomorrow iOS 14 comes out of beta. Honestly I have little to no hope that this will get resolved until I take it in and pay again to get it ‘fixed’. A year of using the iPad as my sole machine has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth. I got into Apple products to not have to worry about this sort of thing. <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250774583?answerId=253440235022#253440235022">I’m also not alone</a>.

			 <p>Taking long walks on a Sunday has become a bit of a thing for me. It lets my mind wander a little. My body gets a little bit of exercise at the same time. Part of this is down to a general sense of anxiety. The soundtrack for this week is Tori Amos ‘Gold Dust’ album. Life is a collection of choices we make and then living with those choices. Everything we experience is down to a choice. To move or to stay. To take action or to wait. To buy or to abstain.</p>

			 <p>📚 I don’t typically like to give up on a book but <em>Essentialism</em> by just could not keep my attention. My cardinal rule when reading a non-fiction book is that it has to inform me and delight me by stretching my brain. Not in its prose but rather in the message and thoughts it is trying to convey. In this instance, even though I read 50% of the book it just isn’t very well written. It lacks a confidence. It lacks a unique sense of style.</p>

			 <p>📚 Currently reading <em>Essentialism</em> by <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/book/">Greg McKeown</a>. While the thesis found inside is fine (although not particularly earth shattering), I have found the writing to be less refined when compared to the writing of Cal Newport or Seth Godin. In fact as I am reading things in a more concentrated manner these last few months I have been able to compare styles of writing when comparing similar topics. Even Ryan Holiday’s style meanders a little too much into what seems like superfluous examples.</p>

			 <p>It took me weeks. It got to the point that Yasmine was sick and tired of me looking at watch websites. Endlessly navigating between different styles, then checking them out on YouTube in the hope that I would be convinced. It didn’t all finally fall into place until this morning. A watch I <em>may</em> have looked at before in passing.</p>
<p>For weeks now I have been trending towards the <a href="https://www.certina.com/dk/watch/ds-8/c0334511104100">Certina DS-8</a>, a more beautiful and understated timepiece you probably are unlikely to find. My problem with it wasn’t the price, it was the very fact of its appeal. It was steel (and there had heft) it was large enough to make it presence felt. I went for utility instead.</p>

			 <p>For the last few weeks I have been spending a stupid amount of time trying to choose a practical daily watch. With my iPhone relegated as a tool I use on occasion and for very specific things, I find myself wondering what time it is more regularly with no instant way of knowing this most basic of information.</p>
<p>Truth is I am struggling with the incredible sea of choice that is available. Getting into the watch game is very similar to getting into anything with a rich history. The options and things you need to get your head around is legion. That is the problem. You cannot find that one watch that satisfies all situations. You likely need a small collection. So the hunt begins.</p>

			 <p>So you want to write and publish a newsletter? Based on my admittedly limited experience (when compared to the torrent of newsletter out there), it seems that the first 100 subscribers is a battle of attrition. Having said that, it is also the single greatest thing I have done online since coming online. In every respect I wish that I had started my letter 10 years ago (when I had the original idea). So here are 5 dos and 5 donts for those thinking or at the start of their journey:</p>
<h2 id="dos">Dos</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do have a clear overarching theme you want to talk about, week after week, month after month. The time between newsletters creeps on you <em>surprisingly</em> quickly.</li>
<li>Do have a schedule. If you&rsquo;ve never done this, start with once per month. Then ramp it up to twice. Only when you know you have the process under control, switch to weekly if you dare.</li>
<li>Do remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.</li>
<li>Do have an opinion. People are there for your voice and your thoughts. Developing this will take time. Embrace it.</li>
<li>Do enjoy the process. You&rsquo;re more likely to last.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="donts">Donts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to start.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be discouraged when days, weeks and sometimes months pass and you get no new subscribers.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged when someone unsubscribes.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be discouraged when nobody forwards your email on - this rarely happens. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever forwarded on my newsletter.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the final look. Email design is an exercise in futility. You could try but there will always be cases when the shit breaks in the worst possible way. Keep it simple, text based, with a few images probably is best.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>For nearly 6 years I used a bullet journal for my entire professional life. I found it provided me with the exact structure for the plethora of tasks in front of me. The last year and a bit I have wandered away. I haven’t been very happy with what I was left with.</p>
<p>I have come back to the fold only in a slightly different manner. I have multiple buckets. Each bucket is a single page. Each page can have notes (if they are super important), but really it is for tasks that I need to finish. By having clearly defined buckets I am able to muster up the necessary courage for the next step with the full knowledge of what I have to do.</p>
<p>Once I have everything in front of me, I want to block when I am going to carry out each of the buckets. This is the difficult part. Which task do I do first and how long will it take? Which task am I paralysed with because I am waiting for a response or input (the biggest killer).</p>
<p>Its a small step to take in what is no doubt going to become an incredibly busy period ahead of me. I’m glad to have been allowed the time to consider and reflect and read and adapt things, processes and thoughts that many others also struggle with.</p>

			 <p>Took a long walk this morning to take stock and review the year that just passed. It has been a real transition year for myself and the family. A rebuilding year. New country. New office. New language. New <em>everything</em>. Then Corona happened. We struggled in the beginning, like the majority of the world. We are now in a better place. Things are not as extreme as they were 6 months ago of course. Summer is officially over, with the weather changing here in Denmark.</p>
<p>Frankly, the change of the weather is not the only change happening around me. I am focusing on things that I am in control of. Very much of life is beyond your control. Remembering what you are able to control every day is super important.</p>
<p>Health wise, I’ve been on the <a href="https://www.nosdiet.com">No S diet</a> for 4-5 months and have lost nearly 10kg in that time. It has not been particularly difficult (except the very start of things) and now when I get to indulge in things (like on my birthday) I don’t feel guilty about it all. Rather I know that tomorrow will be back to my 3 meals, no snacking, no sugar, no seconds. At this rate, I will be back to my pre-marriage weight by Christmas. For all those looking for a way out of their bad eating habits, this is one I can honestly stand behind 100%. It works, when nothing else came close.</p>
<p>From a creative perspective this year has been one of the most incredible in recent years. The readership for my newsletter <em>In Abeyance</em> continues to build, slowly but honestly in a very purposeful manner which I am very happy with. I’m also about to release my the first collection of the first year of the newsletter. Over the summer, the intention was to finish putting together the package. Its 90% there. Easily the most time consuming element being the cover that I have been drawing for a month — I am <em>this</em> close to finish this mega project off and its surprisingly met my original vision. Which I will go into more detail at some point.</p>

			 <p>Around 10 months ago my MacBook failed after a healthy 2 year run. At the time I lamented this fact, but was incredibly happy that it was my MacBook and not my iPad, as the latter offered me the use of drawing artwork and I would have to learn to manage my way around the limitations that iOS offered to do all the <em>other</em> stuff. A couple of weeks ago I upgraded to 13.6 and that was the beginning of the shit show. I got the battery drain bug, and no amount of resetting, restoring, contacting Apple, recovery mode (although not sure how long it lasted for).</p>
<p>Now my iPad is always plugged in as I don’t want to stress the battery in any way until this shit gets sorted out. What a shit storm iPadOS is turning out to be.</p>

			 <p>It turns out that one of the things that I have struggled with over the last few years is called ‘context switching’. You’re doing this thing over <em>here</em>, your brain gets bored, distracted or wanders and now it wants to do this thing over <em>there</em>. The switch comes at a price, your time. You’ll get there eventually I’m sure, but it might take you hours rather than minutes. Months, rather than days.</p>
<p>The first step out of this loop is to recognise that this is happening and also stop yourself as it happens. From there you can start to put the mental pieces in place to prevent it from happening. Traditionally I would just let my brain do its thing. I have started to find the incredible benefit of actually focusing on one subject and bringing my brain back to centre to let it complete the task at hand.</p>
<p>The switch usually happens when the hard part of the task you are doing presents itself. Your brain just gives into something easier. However if you fight the urge even for a <em>fraction</em> you are rewarded pretty quickly. I’m not advocating to eat through a wall every time, but I am saying to keep the pressure up just enough to let your brain flex.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s humid and muggy in Copenhagen tonight.</p>
<p>One of my fondest memories growing up in Greece, was early September. We had just come off a usually 2 1/2 month break. We had gotten our stationary in order for the new school year. The first signs of winter had begun. In each of those cases, I was the student.</p>
<p>For the first time, I get the winter feeling combined with the start of school, but now its for my son. We got him an awesome <a href="http://www.dakine.com">Dakine backpack and pencil case</a> - a brand I have never heard of before, but I&rsquo;m certainly going to be looking into more in the future. Then I filled his pencil case with Viking and Staedtler pencils - what else right?</p>

			 <p>Our neighbours packed their house today and left Copenhagen for good. They have decided for a more quiet life elsewhere in the country. With kids very similar in age to ours, we were able to compare notes with each other. They offered us some form of guidance through these strange times in a very foreign country. I’ll miss their carefree nature and wish them all the best in their future adventure.</p>

			 <p>For all the time that I have had my iPad it has worked flawlessly. I have mothered this thing, considering it is my primary tool. However in the latest update, iPadOS 13.6, I stumbled onto a nasty battery drain bug that I cannot resolve. Now the thing drains even when it is not doing anything.</p>
<p>I have AppleCare but its not worth the money I paid for it because AppleCare is not international, it is tied to the country you bought it in.</p>
<p>I’ve restored this thing from or without a backup, I’ve factory reset from recovery mode (going to a store because my work computer refuses to recognise the ipad when it is connected). Just at a loss as I depend on this thing for so much.</p>

<p>Last year I decided that these were not for me after having spent several years trying to use it as a journal. The format and size has not worked for me. However I have found that this type of notebook can enter my <em>professional life</em>.</p>
<p>For years I have depended on an A5 bullet journal style notebook. As I meander my way in my working life, what I do day to day has changed. Having adopted the Working Memory method, this Hobonichi Weeks would be how I would capture my thoughts and ideas in paper form, when I am away from something electronic (which surprisingly is happening more and more often).</p>

			 <p>Following reading <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, I’ve found myself circling around Cal Newport and his way of thinking. His <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/">podcast</a> has made my digital detox cut. Even though he sends out two episodes a week, I find the information and discussion to be super useful in a practical sense.</p>
<p>I have been trying to refocus my mind in the little pockets of “free” time that I have available to me. One of the key takes from this week’s episode has been to identify my <strong>daily lynchpin tasks</strong> that over time build in a way that is important to me. Identifying these tasks is only part of the solution. Defining exactly when I want to do this will hopefully help me maintain this task. Each task has an elastic timeline, from 5 minutes to 1 hour tops.</p>
<p>I’ve settled on five separate tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Journalling</strong> - The plan is to begin my night time routine at my journal. 10-15min daily.</li>
<li><strong>Reading</strong> - I have been reading a lot more since the 21st of May, my current log is found over at <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/library">kaa.bz/library</a>. My subscription to <em>The Economist</em> remains, although I want to read finish reading this over the weekend over breakfast. 15-30min daily.</li>
<li><strong>Writing</strong> - My mornings are sacracent. This is where I do my deep work. This is my 30min to 1hour of writing that I allow myself to write by hand or in iA Writer to create the words that I am keen on doing. 30-1hour daily.</li>
<li><strong>Drawing</strong> - This is actually an exercise of relaxation. Doing this after I’ve had my dinner (the kids take an hour to feed, I take 15min, might as well doodle while they procrastinate about eating their veg). 15min daily.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong> - Interspersed is some weekly exercise. 2-3 times a week I’ll be riding my bike. I’ve also started taking some 30-50 minute walks around the neighborhood, solving a problem I might be struggling with and clearing my head from things. I might add a little bit of basketball in there to loosen up as well. Depends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe doing more than I can chew to be honest, but some of these items I think I will be able to do daily, other items I might find that I miss a day or 2 a week. That’s fine, it’s not a sprint, its a marathon. Over time I hopefully will be more consistent.</p>

			 <p>For 26 issues I have been using <a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/">Mailerlite</a> to publish my newsletter. For the most part the experience was perfectly fine except the friction between moving from Markdown into the final email.</p>
<p>I switched over to the rich text editor (which admittedly in beta) and while the output was better, the friction has become unbearable. The interface in Safari iOS also does not work, by their own admission. Simple things like adding a link or deleting is just broken. Its been months of literally no improvement. The few times I have sent a support email, I’ve not had my issue resolved. Again I’m not a paying customer, but what I was reporting were bugs that could be fixed.</p>
<p>So what to do? I think I’m going to be moving back to <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a>. The time spent on formatting a newsletter or wrestling with it could be better spent doing something else entirely. I am trying to reduce the friction in my life and my projects and this certainly qualifies as an important step.</p>
<p>What about the design? I’ve decided it doesnt really matter. Not really. What matters is that my readership get a well formatted email, that is typographically rock solid with a few minor items elements of flair. It’s likely too late for this issue (which comes out on Wednesday) but from next issue for sure.</p>

			 <p>I lost my uncle.</p>
<p>My mother’s face crumbled on the call. She couldn’t hold back the tears. Neither could I.</p>
<p>He was by and large a towering figure in my life. To understand the reverence that I held for this man is to understand my mother’s own upbringing. My uncle was the same age as my father, they were in the same class - small town Lebanon. My uncle however couldn’t finish his schooling. He had to shoulder the responsibility left by his own father. My grandfather died around the ages of 50 (heart attack) and left behind him his wife and eight children. The oldest barely in her early 20s. The youngest barely a child of 4 years old. I remember considering the weight that was on his shoulders. Yet for most of his life my uncle was a jovial character. His smile always warm. Natural.</p>
<p>My favourite memories that are seared into my memory however are as a child he held a special place. He loved kids. So much so that even after raising his fathers, he had seven of his own. During the years of war, he would pick us all up from the airport, an arduous journey, with a smile on his face. The best welcoming committee anyone could hope for. Optimism always shining, even when the country had fallen apart.</p>
<p>In that same mini bus/van he would pile all the cousins (there must have been 10 of us at a time) up and take us to the beach. Then we would go and get the <em>best</em> ice cream in the world (I made sure we had the same at our wedding). When we got home his work was not done, he would line us all up, hose us down from all the sand and salt water before sending us off to our mothers.</p>
<p>Sharp. He was a do-er. He would get shit done. I remember my mother telling me about the times her brother would come back exhausted from work after most of her family had gone to sleep. My mother would make him something to eat and off to bed. Only to wake up again before the family had woken up and repeat the cycle all over again.</p>
<p>He wasn’t a flamboyant character. A man who always lived in modesty. A man who lived two lives. One before and after his stroke. Things changed. There was a brief time where his mind wandered. Then there was a time where he was obsessed with the family tree. Something was lost. In life, you get one body and one mind. Sometimes parts of one fail before the other.</p>
<p>My mother had seen him a few days earlier. They’d talked for 20 minutes (a rarified feat), but he was getting hungry so he had to excuse himself and go. You’d get a few minutes from him here and there. Always in a seeming rush. ‘Don’t worry, we’ll catch up soon.’</p>
<p>My uncle Mohammad died yesteday.</p>

			 <p>I could have given him my old iPhone 6, but I decided to go a little less digital. Zane is fascinated by animals and creatures and nature in general. One of the ‘annoying’ habits he’s developed is asking us to ‘take a picture’ of bugs and beetles and ants. After the 200th fly or whatever it gets a little tiring.</p>
<p>Instead I gave him our last point and shoot Canon I bought 12 years ago. The experience is not great but for a 6 year old it has enough buttons and complexity to allow him to fiddle while taking one picture after the other.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes you need a good old think, a piece of paper and a pen to solve the difficult problems. Today I ‘solved’ two issues that relate back to the work I am doing on <a href="https://www.stet.build/">Stet.Build</a>. The first related to the format that will unlock a bunch of things for me. The second is in how I use Twitter.</p>

			 <p>On our bicycle ride to Valby park, Zane asks me ‘Dad, what is the M-sign for?’. That son is for <em>McDonalds</em> and its an amazing feat that you are 6 years old and we have managed to shelter you from what that establishment provides.</p>
<p>It also goes to shows the strength of branding, considering that intersection had plenty of other symbols, the m-sign stood out from all the noise.</p>

			 <p>One of the things that I have not managed to re-introduce to my life is the act of reading comics. It seems very strange for me, considering I was absolutely obsessed with them while growing up and then well into my 20s as well. They have <em>mostly</em> disappeared from my life as I have decided to concentrate on other projects.</p>
<p>Really the stories that I wish I had completed was <em>Blade of the Immortal</em>, <em>100 Bullets</em>, <em>Saga</em> and <em>Scalped</em>. I’m sure I have missed a shit ton of great books that have been created, but those where stories I had invested a lot of time into and want to find out what happens. Maybe I start there (as I have most of these in some digital format) and work my way slowly back. I do have 9 whole days off starting today, might be a nice way to do a different kind of summer reading.</p>

			 <p>Today I ventured into the office for the first time since the 1st week of March. A little over 4 months has passed. I took my bike for the first time. The ride there was mostly pleasant. Birds chirping. Sounds of church bells in the distance. The city was waking up slowly. Sun was shining in my face.</p>
<p>To look at Copenhagen, is to look at a city that is not going through a pandemic. Nobody is wearing masks. People are in Cafes and restaurants and bars partaking in &lsquo;normal&rsquo; activities. I look outside my office window and I see a swarm of people outside Tivoli waiting for the doors to open.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to square what is going on in this country against what is happening across the world. Its not that Denmark doesn&rsquo;t give a shit, its just that it sees a different threat because of this. Maybe its down to the size of the country? Maybe its how people <em>generally</em> respect the rules here? I expect to make more regular trips into the office to get a new perspective on life. Talk to people other than my wife and kids. Make new connections, but at a slower than usual pace.</p>
<p>Hopefully a second lockdown is not imminent. It took me this long to start to come out of the first one.</p>

			 <p>Its funny how things click into place.</p>
<p>2½ years ago, I’d all but given up on having an online presence. Then Micro.blog came along and gave me a limited framework from which to build something. Similarly I have been wanting to draw more regularly. The process makes calms me, but starting off a drawing was always a challenge. I didn’t make the process easy for myself and every time I would sit down, it was a chore to start. In a similar way, I think I have found a way to make entry simple</p>
<p>I have settled on is focusing on urban sketching. The idea is that this will help me understand how buildings and the built world is put together. I’m also going to be using photo reference. Not to replicate the photo as a drawing, but rather to allow me to travel the world and discover interesting details. I’m also limiting the amount of time I spend, to between 30 min to 1 hour every morning. The drawings don’t have to be a particular size, they just have to be fun. I hope to fill many, many books with tons of sketches.</p>
<p>I guess that is the one thing I would tell me 20 year old self. Provide proper constraints. Make it as easy for yourself as possible. And most importantly pick a time of the day and do it again and again and again.</p>

			 <p>I must have imported around 500 photos and posts from Instagram and Tumblr, which leaves around 1000 posts over a 2½ year period. At first there is a question as to the reason <em>for</em> posting. Simply, it is primarily for myself. My site is one of the first sites I visit every morning. I head on over to the previously page and relive and remember my life from 1, 2 or more years ago. I don’t publish my deepest darkest thoughts (those I chuck into my journal), rather it is fun milestones that I would otherwise not record.</p>
<p>Today for instance was the first time that I took Zane on a long bike ride. It was a little bit stressful at the start as I needed to set some ground rules and make sure he kept close by and didn’t get in the way of other cyclists. Once we were inside the park it was a pure joy of just riding our bikes and exploring a park filled with trees towering above and around us. Its a moment in time, captured for me to see and relive in the future again and again.</p>

			 <p>There was much said and discussed as the world gradually went into lockdown. The one idea that resonated with me was that we should aim to be better coming out than when we went in. For me this happened in two distinct ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Going on the S-diet that I have managed to maintain for nearly 2 months now. Slowly I have seen my overall mood and general face look a little healthier. I don’t think about sugar (except that spoon of honey I might have with my oats). Beer intake has dropped off to a couple a week maximum and snacking has been eliminated (save for a few almonds on occasion).</li>
<li>Reclaimed my attention from my phone and internet.During that time I was able to read multiple books and continue to do so on a regular basis. I have writing on a regular basis. I have had soo many excellent conversations with friends and family that I had also not really done in a long while.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are two major elements of my life that I have felt had gotten away from me. The most encouraging element is that I have been able to maintain.</p>
<p>The very last element that I am now slowly starting to dip my toe in cautiously is social media. That is Twitter and Micro.blog. I am also in no rush to reintroduce this back into my life. For example on Micro.blog I have added Manton and Jean to my RSS feed and that is it for now, as though I was starting from zero and building the list in a very slow and purposeful manner. I don’t ever want to go back to that phase in my life when I was basically scrolling mindlessly. The signal to noise ratio has to be maintained at a point which is giving me joy and value.</p>

			 <p>It’s now been 4 weeks into my digital detox, so its time to review how that’s been going.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>I have said this before and it absolutely remains the case but 4 weeks ago my attention was completely hijacked. I had fallen into a trap that I had enabled and partially built for myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had 50 podcasts that I wouldn’t listen to.</li>
<li>I was subscribed to sites that would collectively pump hundreds of posts every day.</li>
<li>I was subscribed to email newsletters and services that would constantly spam me.</li>
<li>I was part of a few social networks that stole minutes from me throughout the day.</li>
<li>I found myself incapable of concentrating for a sustained period of time.</li>
<li>I would take my phone with me to bed (with the lie that it was acting as a clock, but it really wasn’t). My sleep was terrible as I would wake up in the middle of the night and I could not get back to sleep.</li>
<li>The same phone would be taken with me as we played with the kids and I would let my attention focus on this thing (even if it was for seconds or minutes).</li>
<li>I would visit ‘news’ websites that were blasting bite sized pieces of information that added nothing to my life in the interest of ‘staying current’.</li>
<li>I was texting people, thinking that this was enough for us as communication. Sadly it was nowhere near where it should be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly this had been going on for years. What is <em>even</em> sadder, is that looking around me, I know that I am not alone. If any of the above has resonated with you, then I honestly encourage you to try and read <em>Digital Minimalism</em> by Cal Newport and start thinking about how you want to manage your life.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>Like a switch that had been turned on, I was finally able to be more <em>present</em> around people around me. I have also been more present to people away from me having phoned a number of friends and family that I used to only text.</p>
<p>Sure that number could be a little better but this is barely the first month. There will be plenty of time to review.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>One of the things that I implemented pretty early on is to write, on paper, every morning for about an hour. For sure the amount of writing notes I took in this month far exceed what I have done in a very very long time - if ever.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>This has been one of the biggest joys that I have gotten back. In the space of this time I have managed to read 4 books, 3 issues of the Economist and several mega articles on the internet. Wait, what?</p>
<h2 id="drawing">Drawing</h2>
<p>Somehow I have also been able to get some actual drawing done as well. Not just for <em>In Abeyance</em> but also randomly. Its a slow start but one that I have wanted to include as part of my daily routine for years.</p>
<p>This has been the greatest gift that I could give myself. My evenings are now filled with reading and the occasional show.</p>

<p>I have wanted to keep a sketchbook that I actually use on a daily basis for years. I would keep these books and use them sporadically. This meant books got filled over several years. At the rate I’m going that trend will hopefully change and for once I will <em>actually</em> use all the stationary that I have bought over these years.</p>

			 <p>Something felt off.</p>
<p>I put the final touches on the latest issue and then we went downstairs for the kids to play in the park. I normally take a small notebook with me and just try and collect my thoughts for a few minutes while the kids play in the sand (I hate playing in the sand). Across from me was a tree. I looked up and just thought to myself &lsquo;I can actually see this tree. Why can&rsquo;t I draw the thing?&rsquo; I could see the values, I could see details. So I went back to my favourite teacher, Alphonso Dunn. The man is arguable the <em>best</em> art teacher I have ever had. I recommend you buy both his books and subscribe to his channel. Its all gold.</p>

			 <p>Week 3 of digital declutter&hellip;and it has been properly quiet. Both in my head and in my online world. I haven’t disconnected completely, because frankly that just wouldn’t be practical.</p>
<p>I have let in many newsletters into my life, and unlike before I am reading these in their entirety, rather than skimming. This has meant I am actually loving email now. because it’s all good.</p>
<p>In terms of news, I read through my issue of <em>The Economist</em> and if I want an additional fix,&hellip;I read some more of the issue - the beauty of this publication is that it is dense. I have reached for the online websites out of habit (&amp; likely some boredom) but I have managed to stop myself every time.</p>
<p>Another pillar that fell this week was podcasting. I had a very rough idea of what I wanted to bring back into my life. I limited it to seasonal series (<em>Revisionist History, 13 Minutes from the Moon, Against The Rules</em>), sporadic podcasts (<em>On Margins</em> and <em>Hello Internet</em>), and bi-monthly (<em>Erasable Podcast</em>). The only weekly podcast I have allowed is Akimbo, although this is a 30 minute show. I might also bring <em>99% Invisible</em> back.</p>
<p>I’m also playing a game with myself which is to keep driving the average amount of weekly screentime down week on week. The big margins happened a while ago, but now 10% or 15% is surprisingly meaningful.</p>

			 <p>Every day after work we take the kids downstairs to the various parks around our house. It is one of the main reasons we chose this particular location when we moved as it afforded us not one but close to 7 parks for the kids to play. These last few days Zane has been obsessed with bumblebees. I will happily admit that I did not really appreciate the difference between a bumblebee and a regular honeybee (except maybe that they were bigger and don’t die if they sting you).</p>
<p>Living with a 6 year old nature obsessive will enlighten even the most uninterested 40 year old. Today I go to spend a good 15 minutes look at a tree in bloom covered with all sorts of insects. Honeybees, bumblebees, caterpillars, ladybirds and a magpie. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have spent a fraction of that time if this was 3 weeks ago. Every time I see someone engrossed in their phone missing such life around them I feel a little sad, in the same way that I would feel for someone who could not kick a smoking habit.</p>

			 <p>The last pieces of the puzzle finally fell into place.</p>
<p>I was following around 280 people on Micro.blog, 200 people on Twitter and 200 odd on Instagram. All three services do an equally poor job of creating an environment for reading. You go to your stream and its a long list of posts from these hundreds of accounts. Nothing really tying them together. Mixed in are <a href="https://micro.blog/replies">@replies</a>. There is no visual cues to help you see when someone has written a long piece, compared to shorter thoughts. Crucially, all services draw you in (whether it serves them, like Twitter and Instagram) or not (as is the case with Micro.blog).</p>
<p>So I decided to unfollow everyone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My thinking is that by resetting everything, I only allow certain people into the circle and in a controlled manner. You get access to my attention in the manner that I want and on my time. The gatekeeper to this attention is Feedbin, which has gotten more powerful over the years. Spending some time to organise what goes into Feedbin will allow me to spend targetted amount of time there. It used to be a daily affair, but I imagine I can likely spend an hour total on a weekend and catch up on what every one is doing (and then engage if that is what I want to do).</p>

<p>Micro.blog was the worst at doing this. It took me an hour and 11 minutes  —  interestingly most of those I was following hadn’t posted in over a year. Twitter took around 18 minutes  —   it was a two clicks affair as I had to confirm I wanted to unfollow every time. Instagram took 8 minutes. Tap. Unfollow.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>Having the mental space to do other things than wasting it on the internet introduces previously difficult tasks. Tasks that you may have needed a lot of energy to accomplish become somewhat more plausible and achievable.</p>
<p>This week I spent four and a half hours on my phone. It wasn’t scrolling Twitter or  in Safari or watching Youtube. Rather I was in the Finances app, easily the best of it’s kind and there are many, sorting out our budgets for the rest of the entire year. I’m using the ‘envelope’ method that is achievable within the app (a feature I only recently found out about). Previously I was using a spreadsheet, which while did the job, wasn’t as easy to maintain, and didn’t give you the same insights.</p>
<p>Putting the effort in now reaps multiple benefits moving forwards. For a start the <em>mental overhead</em> is vastly reduced - a subject I intend to write a lot more about in the coming year. You make decisions and you can either stick to them, or knowningly go in a different direction. While life is typically unpredicable we can however put some plans together and manage through things as best as we can.</p>

			 <p>Not sure when it happened, but the best way to read and experience <em>The Economist</em> is on the Kindle. First of all there are no ads. Each article has a small bar at the bottom to show you how far into the article you’ve gotten. It gives you the number of words in the article right at the start (so you are aware of what you’re getting yourself into). You can check the meaning of those clever little words that pepper the articles straight away. Getting through sections and sub-sections is really easy from the top (rather than flicking through pages and pages). And importantly I don’t need to recycle something that has been flown across borders to get to me.</p>
<p>My favourite thing however is the balance in the stories. It doesn’t try to sugar coat things. The whole experience is just so much better for my mental health if I’m honest. I will eventually supplement additional news sources, but it certainly won’t be in the manner that I consumed it previously. For the foreseeable future this magazine gives me an awesome overview of what is going on across the world in a manageable and enjoyable way.</p>
<p>The only area that I wish was done better was better resolution and size of the graphs. The Kindle does not do a very good job with these.</p>

			 <p>One of the things that my digital declutter has allowed me to do is re-evaluate how I consume and collect my news. I used to think that news coverage from the BBC or even CNN would be sufficient for my needs. Every once in a while I’d venture over to the Guardian on occasion (but that paper annoys me more often than not). I would lament the fact that I could never carve out the time to read a whole issue of the Economist every week and carry on scrolling something else.</p>
<p>So to be more purposeful with how I consume my news, I’ve subscribed to <em>The Economist</em> (there is a four week trial period on the Kindle). My news coverage will be a week ‘old’, rather than minutes or even days, but hopefully that will mean that someone has provided the necessary thought and nuiance into the coverage itself. I also like how <em>The Atlantic</em> presents itself, however I think that this is too America focused for my liking.</p>

<p>Writing is often <em>messy</em> business. At least in those initial stages when a piece is not fully formed. You have the various threads. The ideas are relatively clear in your mind. They’re just all in the wrong place. Paper doesn’t judge. It doesn’t care for such things. I’ve ‘relearnt’ the importance of staying on paper for as long as possible.

<p>Two weeks into my digital declutter and this is what my mornings are now starting to look like. Spend as much time on the paper before moving to digital.

			 <p>We were talking about sleep yesterday (something we have talked about regularly for 6 years now since our first was born and decided to destroy that most fragile of things). One of the incredible gifts that I have gotten since relegating my phone to a distant tool (probably my 5th or 6th favourite piece of technology at the moment, a thought I would have considered madness 2 weeks ago), is that my sleep has been noticeably and vastly improved.</p>
<p>I would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and find it difficult to get back to sleep. My brain would start working at 100%, ideas, thoughts flashing into my head and there to <em>feed</em> me something was always my phone at my bedside. Part of the reason I let this happen is because I love the internet. Its an incredible resource and one of my favourite human inventions&hellip;when we use it correctly.</p>
<p>I do however feel completely disconnected from the world, having not read a headline in 2 weeks. I have no idea what is going on in the world. I don’t know how well or badly Corona is going. I have not followed along with Seth Meyers and Trumps latest antics. Rather I have been getting into the head of Seneca and a 50 year old Hayao Miyazaki.</p>

			 <p>One of the things about being hyper aware of where your time goes on your machine (because it’s not all that common), is that you can actually analyse what you are spending time on. In this case I spent 2 hours on a single chart for the upcoming newsletter. Why? Because AmCharts. While super powerful is also pretty hard to understand what the 2000 options actually do. I am thankful that the service exists, I do wish that there was a simpler option available. I’ve considered just making things in numbers and publishing images. Whats stopped me is that the interactive charts are delightful and can contain a lot more information that is digestable.</p>

			 <p>While many swear by Marcus Aurelius and his <em>Meditations</em>. My favourite philosopher is Seneca. Something about the way he frames his arguements. The topics he chooses, resonate best with me. I’m currently reading <em>On the Shortness of Life</em>, which is incredibly apt for this new path of reclaiming my time. This line comes early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it&hellip;So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the whole book is filled with so much goodness, this one also resonated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die.</p>

			 <p>I used to be a voracious reader. That seems to have been at least 10 years ago. Before my attention was hijacked. I let it happen. It was easy. Click. Tap. Swipe. Swipe. Swipe.</p>
<p>Five days into my digital declutter and I have read two books (amongst a range of other activies that don’t involve the internet). In the last decade this act would usually have taken me 2 to 3 months.</p>
<p>I remember reading once how one of Stephen Kings advice to new writers was to read. Read widely. Over 50 books a year. I also remember thinking to myself that this is fantasy. This was impossible. This was never sustainable. At my peak I could barely finish 1 book every 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll reach 50, but I intend to reclaim my reading habits. I think I have around 30 unread books in my little library and on my kindle.</p>

			 <p>For over a year now I have written my bi-monthly newsletter exclusively on a computer. On the odd occasion I might write a few notes down. A couple of sentences. Maybe sketch some ideas. I never would write very much before quickly jumping back onto the screen. When I needed to FAQ check something, I would jump online and search for it,sometimes returning back to base to continue writing, sometimes not.</p>
<p>The latest issue has been written by hand first. The thoughts and ideas, structure and points that I want to make written by hand. It’s a decidedly different way of approaching the same thing, but I feel that this is a very purposeful approach. The words and structure is not fully formed. Things change from the written word to the typed word, but much of the <em>meandering</em> is carried out on paper first. When it then comes to typing, the act is oh so much easier. Direct.</p>
<p>Two thoughts. I’m not going to dwell on the past. That is done. I write these things to remind myself never to lapse. Its much better being in control even if it’s a little bit less convienient. The end result is better for it.</p>

			 <p>Looking outside my window is a reasonably busy road (by Danish standards), I think there might be at least 10 cars passing through every hour. Cyclists however travel on this road in their 10s in the same time. One of the things I have noticed is the fact that oftentimes I will see people cycling while checking their phones.
On the other side, is one of the busy parks in my community. It’s home to three trampolines in the ground and kids are always playing here with their parents in tow, who are checking their phones. I used to be one of these people. Oh sure I tried to keep the damn thing in my pocket, but I know I failed to do that on many occasions.</p>
<p>We should not be slaves to our devices and technology. Technology should be our tools. Yet our monkey brains finds the appeal of something shiney to strong to resist. It feeds on our base instincts of not wanting to be bored. Of being entertained. Of <em>trying</em> to be more ‘productive’ with our time. The technology is so pervasive, it quickly becomes our comfort blanket.</p>
<p>They really should have a mental health warning whenever you buy one of these things.</p>

			 <p>For over a year now I have watched Seth Godin publish to his blog every single day. What struck me the most about these posts was the endless well that he was pulling ideas from and giving them form and pressing publish. What’s even more impressive is that he has been on this train for years. I always wondered what his secret was. He attributed to not having a television. I barely watch television, except specific shows that I watch with general intention. So why couldn’t I focus? Why couldn’t I do the same?</p>
<p>What was missing from the conversation was my phone. My phone offered the biggest distraction. It had hijacked my brain. This was then further augmented by how I used my computer. I let it happen to me again and again, even though I <em>thought</em> I was being mindful. While I was able to create and write a decent amount during this time, I did so inspite of being overwhelmingly distracted. It was very hard to focus. I’m now looking forward to seeing what I am able to produce and read and draw and create with this new found attention.</p>
<p>We’re taught a lot of things sadly we are also ignorant of a lot more. While the digital technology can be powerful and liberating, it can also have the ability to hijack our attentions without remorse.</p>

			 <p>Everyone gets 24 hours. My general perception was that we chose how to use those 24 hours. Sadly for a while now my 24 hours had been hijacked. I knew something was up a year ago, but its taken me till now to finally understand how bad the situation had become. Maybe Corona allowed me to get really bad again before I realised that something was fundamentally amiss.</p>
<p>I remember Stephanos, my friend Stathi’s father, tell me how he quit smoking. He was in his shop shouting to his wife that he couldn’t find his pack of cigarettes.  Meanwhile he had a lit one in his mouth, he was holding another lit one and there was a third one in an ashtray infront of him. He swears he didn’t see any of them until it was pointed out to him what was going on.</p>
<p>Everyone should re-evaluate their digital habits. If you’re anything like me, you’re in soo deep you don’t even realise what is happening.</p>

			 <p>At the time I genuinely thought that I was lucky. Leaving the UK in 2009, coincided with Facebook gaining popularity. I had a conricopia of communication apps that I could use to keep in touch with my friends. Instead my lizard brain decided not to do that.</p>
<p>What I found was that my conversations with friends and family to have diminished completely. Even connecting was difficult. It didn’t need to be that way. I let the fact that I hadn’t spoken to many people get the better of me. I felt embarassed that I had let the time between conversations slip away. It’s something I have always struggled with.</p>
<p>One of the best chapters in <em>Digital Minimalism</em> is about conversations (talking, phone calls and video calls) compared to connections (text messages &amp; comments). It has really resonated with me. It is a little upsetting that I’ve effectively lost 10 years or conversations, but I think the friendship is strong enough to endure this short passage of time as we all got busy having families.</p>

			 <p>I’m going on a digital declutter for a month.</p>
<p>When I come out of this month, hopefully I’ll have decided what is truely important for me across everything. Podcasts, Spotify, social media, messages, phone calls, websites, RSS feeds, Youtube, Netflix. All this stuff just added more and more clutter to my mind. It wasn’t a lot of time on each either, but it was death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Removing Safari from my phone has enabled me read half a book in the time that I reclaimed from that single act alone. What can I reclaim if I turn off or remove everything else?</p>
<p>Castro was a difficult one to delete, but it’s gone. Spotify is out. Tweetbot gone. The Micro.blog app (and Gluon and Icro) are all gone. Instead I bought Mimi for posting photos and obviously having Drafts lets me post everything.</p>
<p>I’ve added an app called Portal to give me some ambient sounds while I work and have my noise cancelling headphones on. My Pimsleur app now gets a prominent position, along with my Kindle app. Reminders is now on my phone again.</p>
<p>Email apps are off the phone, I only will check these once a day and mostly to get rid of services that have taken liberties with my email address. Before I did that I archived everything in my apps to start fresh. If I needed something then I can always search for it. The</p>
<p>My phone now becomes a place to read my books, learn Danish, or its a functional tool  — buy groceries, log activities, take photos, write notes. My iPad is a place where deliberate work is carried out. Writing, editing, drawing, designing.</p>

Secondly, data centres account for around 1% of all global energy use. What’s more impressive is the fact that these values have remained flat since 2015.</p>

			 <p><del>Posting to my site and having full control of everything has been one of the most rewarding things I’ve done online.  also want to give credit to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and the Micro.blog system which also gives you control of how you share your information more widely.</del></p>
<p><del>I recently decided I wanted to control what I post to my <a href="https://twitter.com/kaa_pow">Twitter</a> and LinkedIn accounts. I’ve decided to use both as a means to post similar types of information, which will be different from what I typical post to my <em>personal</em> site. What I didn’t want to do is create more work for myself — having to post the exact same thing two or three times. So I created a new category and hooked the category RSS feed up to post to these services. My site remains the one source of everything.</del></p>
<p><del>A few bonus items:</del></p>
<p><del><a href="https://micro.blog/craigmcclellan">@craigmcclellan</a> has an awesome <a href="https://craigmcclellan.com/2019/01/31/new-post-to.html">Drafts with categories action</a>. The information on the <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2016/cross-posting-twitter/">Micro.blog help</a> site is very good in understanding how Micro.blog handles the cross-posting.</del></p>
<p><del>The year of consolidation continues.</del></p>
<p>Scratch all of that. It turns out RSS control on Micro.blog doesn&rsquo;t really work this way. There is some funny limitations under the hood. Basically you can&rsquo;t control your RSS feeds in this manner.</p>

			 <p>So it’s been an entire week on the <a href="http://nosdiet.com">No S diet</a>. The first few days were relatively easy as I was enthusiastic. The next few days were a little more difficult. Now it has become a way of life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are just three rules and one exception:<br>
No Snacks.<br>
No Sweets.<br>
No Seconds.<br>
Except (sometimes) on days that start with &ldquo;S&rdquo;.<br>
That&rsquo;s it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The no seconds has been tough. No snacking has been tougher. Actually the no sugar has been much easier than I imagined. Although it’s only been 7 days, I actually feel <em>lighter</em>. Not physically, but mentally. I enjoy and tend to savour my food more these days because it is several hour between meals. You get to eat whatever you want, just portion controlled and at very distinct times of the day. It’s also helped me slow the speed that I used to eat. I think it’s the simplicity of the diet that might make it stick with me.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t do on purpose was to weigh myself. I decided to just see how this new routine makes me feel (apart from hungry at the moment) and how my clothes feel on me. Everything else is immaterial.</p>

			 <p>I now have no excuse. I used the last iteration of the MacBook for 6 years and loved that machine. The new MacBook Air is looking pretty good as well. I now have both options to choose from. No wondering about a mythical laptop that might come down the line. It&rsquo;s here.</p>

I discovered <a href="https://everydaysystems.com/habitcal/">HabitCal</a> and <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/">The No S diet</a> - they are by the same author Reinhard Engels, who is very funny.

			 <p>Some people bake bread. Others collect watches. Some watch birds. I collect iOS text editors.  Scratch that, I spend an incredible amount of time considering, testing and playing with text editors on iOS. It all started out looking for a text based nirvana. Ultimately my quest for that perfect editor has come up short as it has now dawned on me that the perfect text editor <em>doesn’t</em> exist. Rather what I have come to realise is that there are several amazing editors that have a number of strengths and weaknesses. The trick is to find the <em>collection</em> that best compliment each other in your quest for capturing and further developing your thoughts.</p>
<p>My collection of apps that I love on iOS are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.1writerapp.com/">1Writer</a></li>
</ol>
<p>To that collection I have recently added <a href="https://www.getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> as it has become my replacement <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a> on the Mac. My long held belief that the modal design established by <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was/is the ultimate method for capturing and searching for text. Drafts introduces another way that is equally as powerful, only different.</p>
<h2 id="getting-over-the-omnibar">Getting Over the Omnibar</h2>
<p>In The Archive, once you open the app, the cursor is in the omnibar which lets you create or search for a note. In creating a note, you type in some words, which then become the name of the file and the first line of the new file. It’s an incredibly powerful concept that has not been replicated successfully on iOS yet (although there have been some flawed attempts).</p>
<p>Drafts does away with the search. For Drafts, by default, the first thing that you are allowed to is start writing in a blank file. That is where you start. If you want to search, there are three ways, press the search icon in the bottom right hand corner (prime location), press <em>shift+command+f</em> or pull down to reveal the search. The reason this is better for iOS is the fact that this entire app is replicated on the iPhone, with a single exception (that I can find), which is pinning the sidebar (this seems to only be available on the iPad).</p>
<h2 id="getting-over-the-clutter">Getting Over the Clutter</h2>
<p>One of the things that drove me away from using Drafts was that I thought it was too cluttered. I had bought into the minimal aesthetics provided by iA Writer and I liked it that way.</p>
<p>Except Drafts is more function over form. In many ways, this app is the total antithesis of iA Writer. The icon isn’t great (although you can change it). Both the overall graphic direction of the app and the iconography for the groups sidebar leave a lot to be desired. I’ve quickly learnt not to care.</p>
<p>Being able to write whatever I want and then call up a function and publish to my website in microseconds makes the function trump any ugly iconography found within the app itself. That is where I started seeing that there is more to this app than meets the eye. I published exclusively from it for 2 months before realising that all of my thoughts should live in here. Thoughts that need to be expanded upon can get moved over to iA Writer for a more <em>refined</em> experience.</p>
<h2 id="workspaces">Workspaces</h2>
<p>The Archive has a similar feature to this, except it wasn’t graphically implemented as elegantly as this. This feature is available, but it is mostly hidden.</p>
<p>What I love about this particular feature is the fact that I can flip between different frames of mind. I want to write some thoughts about engineering? There’s a workspace for that. Something for this site? There’s a workspace for that. General reference texts? Yup, there’s a space for that.</p>
<h2 id="deep">Deep</h2>
<p>Rearranging the text within a file, as per blocks, sentences or lines is an excellent idea that I’ve not encounter anywhere else. The fact that it has a shortcut for just about everything shows that the developer understands what is important. Version history for all your text is there and readily available within the app. And on the list goes. <a href="https://micro.blog/cm">@cm</a> called this app deep which is such an excellent description of what this app has to offer.</p>
<h2 id="subscription-model">Subscription Model</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the subscription model used and would have preferred if the subscription model established by Sketch was used instead. You pay once and continue to use the app that you paid for at that point in time for as long as you want. For 1 year you get all monthly updates. If you want future updates after that year, you have to pay again. Not sure what happens to all my Workspaces when the year is over tbh.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is plenty of room for the app to improve. The aforementioned graphical shortcomings. The selection of themes could be better, maybe something similar to those provided in <a href="http://serpensoft.info/">iWriter Pro</a>. The fact that there isn’t a baked in path to exporting the text as a series of files, which goes against some of what I want (but there might be a pretty easy workaround for that).</p>
<p>These are <em>quibbles</em> in what is otherwise one of the most pro writing app on <em>any</em> platform.</p>

			 <p>It took two months but I finally decided to go the pro route for Drafts. I <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2020/02/22/i-orginally-didnt.html">started tinkering</a> with the app 2 months ago now, but I realised I should have gone all in the second my MacBook died on me. I have long consider <a href="http://notational.net">Notational Velocity</a> (followed by <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a>)the quintessential app for notes, but Drafts was able to convince me that there is a better way.</p>
<p>I have a much larger series of posts to make on text editors on iOS in general, but if you’ve not given <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> a go, I highly recommend it for the correct type of writing and note collecting. I have only <em>just</em> started to scratch the surface of what this app is capable of, but every time I discover a new detail or feature, I’m just amazed at how versatile this app can be.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s now been 6 months in Denmark.</p>
<p>The first month was a whirlwind to try and get everyone registered and finding a house. The second month was spent preparing for Christmas and surviving New Years in Denmark. The next two months was trying real hard not to fall into a massive depression due to the cold, dark, windy winter (I lie, it was refreshing experiencing the cold after so many years in the desert). The next two months were spent at home.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the coming two months, home based working will continue for a little while longer, certainly as we enter spring (in the <a href="/c01">Kurt Vonnegut</a> definition) and likely into parts of the summer. I am finally starting to look at buying a bike for myself and Zane who turns 6 very soon, so that will hopefully change how I see Copenhagen a little, delivering on one of the many promises this land held for us when we decided to come here.</p>

			 <p>Today was the first time we took the kids out in 4 days. My mind has been seriously preoccupied so didn&rsquo;t have the energy, but if it wasn&rsquo;t the best medicine for your mood and a little nature.</p>
<p>It started off with seeing a magpie breaking a large branch from one tree, trying and trying again to pick it up and taking it to his/her nest.</p>
<p>This was then followed up with seeing a ladybird that the kids absolutely went crazy for - first time the little one has seen one and its wings were soo bright against the grassy background.</p>

			 <p>Everyone is going through a number of changes in their lives and trying to adapt. It&rsquo;s now been 4 weeks since this lockdown began for us. At first it was about getting over the shock. Now it&rsquo;s about settling in and doing things purposefully. As an absolute minimum in Denmark this is going to go on here for another month - although that is on the optimistic side of things. To make the transition even more disorienting, the changing of hours only added to my routine upheaval. Something I&rsquo;ve not had to deal with for 8 years, I forgot that it messes your brain for at least 2 weeks, until you get your circadian rhythms back.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first month I experimented with a beard. While it was pretty cool not to have to shave every day, it&rsquo;s not for me. Maybe when I&rsquo;m in my 50s and really, really don&rsquo;t give a shit. Now I give half a shit.</li>
<li>Working from home has shown me what it would actually be like. With young kids. I have found that there are plenty of hours where I am super focused on what I am doing and the time genuinely flies. However it has come at a price. The price of <em>my</em> own time. Where previously I had very distinct lines that I managed, these lines have now been blurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the next month, I&rsquo;m going to try and be more purposeful with our new reality.</p>
<ul>
<li>While some exercise has made it&rsquo;s way into my day, I want to be a little more purposeful with this. There is a time of the day this happens, just need to extend</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to write more regularly, both in my journal and online. To do something you have to set an actual time of the day that you do this. Journalling happens when I first wake up and when I go to be. Online writing can happen at any point in the day.</li>
<li>I want to get through some more books. Rather than checking the same damn websites again and again. Then open my emails. Then back to my RSS reading. Then lets check Micro.blog&hellip;hmmm I wonder what is happening on MySpace these days&hellip;RSS is awesome&hellip;.oh time for bed. I honestly have a ton of books that I really want to get into but the amount of easier distractions has overcome me.</li>
<li>There are some awesome shows I&rsquo;d also like to get into, with <em>Better Call Saul</em> coming to an end (for this penultimate season). Maybe watch <em>See</em> or <em>Stranger Things</em> or <em>The Mandalorian</em>. There are a few Pixar movies I&rsquo;ve not watched including <em>Coco</em>, <em>Toy Story 4</em> and <em>Outbound</em>.</li>
<li>I want to make sure I do my Danish lessons while doing the dishes every single day. This was going well for a few days, before it stopped. Need to get back on that wagon.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>End of week four of living &amp; working in the house. As we settle into our new reality, my old routines has been completely upended, but I&rsquo;ve been looking to add new ones and re-establish the old ones.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I&rsquo;ve finally gotten my writing mojo back. For the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been spending an inordinate amount of time looking at graphs, getting upset and then doing it again a few minutes later. Needless to say it wasn&rsquo;t doing my mental health any good.</p>
<p>I missed my deadline for <em>In Abeyance</em> as it was important that I write something that brought some clarity to everything that is going on around us at the moment. Like most people my mind has been completely overcome by a fog which is slowly lifting.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I was reminded of the single best trick from <em>Atomic Habits</em>, which is to stack your habits. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get back into learning Danish again. My commute all but stopped it as repeating Danish words again and again on a public train would make me the weirdo on the train. However sorting out the kitchen/dishes after dinner is a prime time to do a 30 minute lesson. Stacking these two habits together really works for me.
Another habit I&rsquo;m stacking is doing a HIIT session with the kids right after the working day is over. Helps me get out of whatever issues where in my head throughout the day and lets me play and interact with the kids straight away.</p>

			 <p>Years ago, when I was in University, Dan introduced me to the Iranian new year, Nowruz. He spoke with such enthusiasm about this day. How ridiculous our current new year is considering it happens at the darkest, wettest, coldest part of the year. It made no sense. <em>It makes no sense</em>. Rather, Iranians celebrated new years on the first day of spring. Spring is a time where the tide turns. When the days become more bountiful. When the sun begins to shine a bit more.</p>
<p>For myself, living in Scandinavia, it&rsquo;s also the time when everyone south of us gets less sunlight than us. We&rsquo;ve had to endure a long winter, now comes our reward. Copenhagen is showing it&rsquo;s spring colours today. I&rsquo;m thankful for that at least.</p>

A lot of thoughts and ideas in my head (just like everyone else on the planet) as we all try and find <em>some</em> answers to all our legitimate and difficult questions. I have two links that gave me clarity and some reassurance on our collective future.</p>
<p>The first one is <a href="https://www.kottke.org/tag/COVID-19">from Kottke</a>, who has been nailing the COVID-19 coverage, and is an expansive article that really deserves your full attention. If there is one article you are going to read in full about this, <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56">let it be this one</a>. Hopefully it will give you the necessary clarity it has given me.</p>
<p>The next one is a <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/03/calm-also-has-a-coefficient/">much shorter affair</a> and just plain good advice from Seth.</p>

			 <p>Like many I am currently grappling with what is going on around the world. Trying desperately not to keep refreshing my newsfeeds to get a glimpse of even the tiniest piece of information. In a constant loop that is breaking my head if I&rsquo;m honest.</p>
<p>When does civil society break down exactly? This is a question that is not too far away from my mind. We live in such a precarious time at the moment. Where a virus can kill thousands of people by touching them. Nobody is prepared. Everyone is either scared or should be.</p>
<p>Then I remind myself that we are humans. We build. It’s what we do. We build airports. We build homes. We build schools and museums and mausoleums. We build aeroplanes and rockets. We build systems. We build hospitals. We build our future.</p>
<p>So looking to that future, here are two wishes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I hope that when we come out of this, hopefully soon, we are able to enforce change. We now understand how fragile this world we have built truly is.</li>
<li>I also want to hope that this virus will ultimately bring us closer together as we all come to understand that in this life there are no Chinese or American, Russian or Syrian; there is only <em>human</em>.</li>

			 <p>Like many around the world we are effectively locked in and self isolating. Family of four confined to our little apartment. Yesterday the weather was incredible and invited us out for a little bit. Having said that we were <em>incredibly</em> conscious of everything the kids touched and of any people within 10m of us.</p>
<p>My favourite quote during this whole time has come from the Italian Foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our grandfathers were drafted to go to war; we&rsquo;re being asked to stay at home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting everything into context, this is hardly a hardship. It just needs discipline to not go a little bit loopy and remain patient (with everything and everyone) . For my part I have been using this time to reflect and try and come out of this a slightly better person than when we entered this thing.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop-ios">Cardhop</a> has got to be one of the most impressive apps on iOS, it&rsquo;s actually let me take control of my contacts. Something I have <em>never</em> had any control over. I bought it when it first came out and never used it. Big mistake. I&rsquo;ve been using it all weekend and it&rsquo;s an absolute joy to use as it&rsquo;s taken me down memory lane and made me relive my contacts with so many people. I&rsquo;ve even started reaching out to a few of them as a result of this clarity. Going forward maintaining the garden is key.</p>

			 <p>I finally sat down and really thought about how I want to use my iPhone &amp; iPad. Turns out I&rsquo;ve seriously let my digital garden go completely wild over the last few years. My contacts are all over the place. The less said about my photos the better. My emails accounts are out of hand. My files are in slightly better condition (but even then, it will need some consideration). Thankfully there are some seriously awesome tools made for just this thing. The plan is to try and deal with one area every month.</p>
<p>Top of my list on this journey is <a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop-ios">Cardhop</a>. These <a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop-ios/videos#overview">videos for Cardhop</a> by David Sparks is a seriously great introduction to the power behind this deceptively simple looking app.</p>

			 <p>Great video by Vox explaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpoJGYlW54&amp;feature=youtu.be">why new diseases keep appearing in China</a> and why these may continue to appear. Unlike America&rsquo;s lack of gun control (which is terrible) affects Americans within their borders. The Chinese government&rsquo;s policies to not only allow but actively encourage wildlife farming practices (which is awful, even without the addition of disease to the mix), have a significant affect across the entire world. Hopefully world governments can put enough pressure on China to finally put an end to this.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://twitter.com/olemoritz/status/1225668553040224259">This thread on Twitter</a>, regarding the future of the <em>Editorial</em> app for iOS is bittersweet. Even though the app hasn&rsquo;t been updated (apart from a few maintenance releases) in an age, it&rsquo;s still an incredibly solid editor - a testament to how advanced the app was compared to others around it. I would say it is still the best app for Dropbox sync, Taskpaper features and Fountain support.</p>
<p>One of the most important parts associated with any app, is it&rsquo;s longevity, which is the only major ding against lone developers. I love to support them, but at the same time you always run the risk of any number of issues halting future development. In this case it&rsquo;s clearly not lack of enthusiasm. I do hope everything works out for him and he&rsquo;s able to work through any issues he&rsquo;s going through.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe he can come back stronger with a future release.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I really miss my MacBook.
I&rsquo;m a firm believer that using the right tool makes you happier and is therefore more sustainable in the long run.
Since September, I have been <em>relegated</em> to using my iPad Pro exclusively for all my needs. In some ways, it has been both a revelation and joy to use. In other respects, it has been abject misery.</p>
<h2 id="protability">Protability</h2>
<p>Where the iPad shines for me is it&rsquo;s portability. This thing is incredibly light. Solidly built and has an incredible battery that keeps on going and going. The fact that the pencil is magnetically attached to the top means it&rsquo;s always charged and ready to go. All in all, it is definitely the road warrior that I imagined it to be.
I opted for the 12.9&quot; version, which is right for me, in most cases. It gets a bit big when I write notes, but this is mainly a mindset thing that I need to get past and work into my routine.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-support">Keyboard Support</h2>
<p>While this isn&rsquo;t <em>perfect</em>, I use this with two keyboards. One by Apple and it&rsquo;s perfect and the other by Logitech and it works great at work as I need to flip between a Windows machine and my iPad.
The only issue I&rsquo;ve ever really had is that sometimes support across various apps has been pretty buggy recently. Most notably with iAWriter, the keyboard goes haywire if I switch between apps. Its restored only when I restart the app.</p>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<p>Apps like <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a>, <a href="https://procreate.art/">Procreate</a>, <a href="https://2ttf.com/">iFontMaker</a>, <a href="https://www.cateater.com/">Stop Motion Pro</a>, and <a href="https://pdfexpert.com/">PDFExpert</a> truly shine on this machine in a way that other apps cannot. There are the apps that have been adapted exceptionally well. <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>. <a href="https://soulver.app/">Soulver</a>. <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>. <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/">Affinity&rsquo;s Photos and Designer</a> work surprisingly well but they falter by the limitations of the iPad&rsquo;s poor support of a mouse which is where these types of apps shine.</p>
<p>Then there are the apps that don&rsquo;t exist on the platform. The Archive. Affinity say that they are working on a version for their Publisher app, but until then, creating books isn&rsquo;t really all that possible - sure there is Pages&hellip;but I mean, c&rsquo;mon guys. It&rsquo;s called an iPad Pro. No Web Developer tools of note. The ones available are barely ok, but certainly not as powerful as what already comes with desktop safari.</p>
<h2 id="buggy-software">Buggy Software</h2>
<p>This is something that I have noticed a sharp addition of bugs for iOS13. It&rsquo;s not been great. Everything from dictionary support to weird and wonderful bugs with the keyboard support. As this is my main machine for production, it&rsquo;s frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
<p>Yes, you can have your own fonts installed, except for some reason, it&rsquo;s only through third party apps (none of which are very good). Why the hell isn&rsquo;t this baked into the OS?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="fixing-it">Fixing It</h2>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s fashionable to pile onto the iPad at the moment. The truth is that it wouldn&rsquo;t take very much for me not to pine over my macbook.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the Safari Developer Tools.</li>
<li>Give proper mouse support to the OS.</li>
<li>Design a nice interface for font management.</li>
<li>Sort out the bugs related to the keyboard support.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="moonshot">Moonshot</h2>
<p>The thing that would be the real game changer for me is if the 3rd party developers are enticed to actually develop real productivity software for the platform. I’d love to see ports of Mac apps on iOS. Make it happen Apple. It’s the sort of crazy shit Steve Jobs would ask for. This would allow me to have <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a>, <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a>, <a href="https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/">Highland</a>, Marsedit and any number of other great Mac apps that I have already paid for and currently have no way to use.</p>

			 <p>In another ding against iCloud, if you find that files you created in iAWriter on your iPhone are not syncing to your iPad (something that has been happening regularly since September), the trick is to open the Files app on your phone, which will then coax iCloud to wake up and take the new information created. OneDrive hasn&rsquo;t been great either. Say what you will about Dropbox, but those guys have always had sync down to an art.</p>

			 <p>I orginally didn&rsquo;t really give <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> a fair shake. It wasn&rsquo;t until I tried it on the iPad that I finally understood where it can fit into my text writing life - specifically it makes for a great Micro.blog editor.</p>
<p>This particular editor is in many ways the antithesis of my preferred editor <a href="https://www.ia.net/writer">iAWriter</a>. Where iAWriter gives you <em>some</em> customisation options, these are very considered. Drafts goes the other way and basically lets you control just about every aspect of the editor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not gone for the pro version just yet, as I&rsquo;m trying to see how/if this thing has legs for me.</p>

			 <p>Truly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/02/03/802422904/when-things-click-the-power-of-judgment-free-learning">fascinating episode</a> of <em>Hidden Brain</em>, regarding the use of clickers to teach humans. I&rsquo;ve been going through the frustrations described here as I try and teach my five year old different things. I&rsquo;ve realised that with Zane he sometimes has to learn from his own mistakes, as no amount of talking will do that. The latest is how to hold and use a pencil. It&rsquo;s not until he&rsquo;s started to develop a calus on his hand (from drawing!) that he is considering listening about maybe changing the way he holds the pencil.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also been using the term &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; a lot recently, which I try and discourage by telling him that he hasn&rsquo;t even tried yet. I should change my approach, as I clearly lack some empathy of understanding what he&rsquo;s going through.</p>

			 <p>One of the clearest data points in our transition to Denmark is the nearly complete shift from eating out on a regular basis to eating exclusively from home. Slowly we have been adding different types of foods to our cooking repetoire. Yasmine&rsquo;s been getting into baked muffins in a big way, as she continues to experiments with all kinds of ingredients.</p>
<p>From my side, I finally attempted and <em>mostly</em> landed the ever ellusive potato bun for a hamburger. If like me you are a burger connosieur, you understand that the bun <strong>makes</strong> the burger. You&rsquo;re very liable to forgive a lot more of what goes inside the burger, but if the bun isn&rsquo;t right, then the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>The receipe I would totally recommend is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN-AvNQcsRA">this one by Food Wishes</a>. When I first heard Chef John, I thought this is a joke right? His tone grows on you and then the humour comes in, which is a nice touch. The only part I will be tweaking is the amount of yeast. I&rsquo;ll be using 1½ teaspoons rather than the recommended 2½ as it smelt too yeasty for our liking. The other part is that I think the buns could be a little larger, so maybe use halves rather than quarters.</p>
<p>The other video I would recommend is the one about making a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04xuIuTcti0">Shake Shack burger</a>. It&rsquo;s a classic burger where less is more.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2014, feeling that Facebook was not making me happy and after the initial euphoria of ‘connecting’ with old friends and family wore off, I decided to leave the platform. Knowing all too well that Instagram was part of Facebook, I reluctantly stayed on the platform because I liked my grid of photos. I knew that it wasn’t going to be a sustainable solution for me.</p>
<p>Thankfully I didn’t need to wait an exceedingly long time for a better solution to come along. That solution was <a href="https://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, which today marks two years since I first started using the service.</p>
<p>As the platform and it’s tools, have developed the way I use it has also changed, from mainly on the desktop to mainly on mobile. This year I would like to contribute something more to this service (I have a couple of ideas). Needless to say that I heartily recommend you consider it as your place on the web.</p>

			 <p>The single biggest change anyone can make to their site is sorting out the typography. There are plenty of freely available typefaces out there. My favourites are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">IBM Plex</a> (Sans Serif, Serif and Mono), <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> (Sans Serif), <a href="https://ebensorkin.wordpress.com">Merriweather</a> (Sans Serif and Serif) and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-sans">Source Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-serif">Source Serif</a>, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html">Charter</a> (Serif) &amp; <a href="https://01.org/clear-sans/downloads">Clear Sans</a> (Sans Serif).</p>
<p>The issue is that because they are freely available, they offer little distinction as they can be used by everyone. Sometimes that&rsquo;s what you want. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not. If I was running an up and coming blogging platform (<em>ahem</em> <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>), I&rsquo;d try and hook up with indie typographers. People like <a href="https://practicaltypography.com">Matthew Butterick</a>, <a href="http://mikamelvas.fi">Mika Melvas</a> or even a foundary like <a href="https://tipotype.com">TipoType</a>. See if I can strike some kind of deal to allow everyone to use their fonts across my platform.</p>

			 <p>Woke up this morning to the news of the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. I fear that shit just got very real. We will not feel the ramifications of this action until much later. The truth is, all my fear about putting the 🍊 one in the White House are starting to materialise.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to remember that this current wave of escalation all began with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html">America pulling out of the Iran Nuclear deal</a> that used diplomacy rather than drones to control the situation. That was the action of someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand international diplomacy and still lives in the 1950s. None of this was necessary. None of what is likely going to happen was necessary. If you think that this is the end of it and that Iran won&rsquo;t do something in retaliation, then clearly you&rsquo;ve not been paying much attention.</p>

			 <p>2019 was the year of release was one that set up foundations for a lot of the projects I wanted to focus on. I had been working on these projects at different stages in the previous years. The intention of this year was to stop working in the background and start to release as many of these as possible.</p>
<p>Using this guiding principle, I was able to issue the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/c01">Calendar C01</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a> website</li>
<li>Stet.build logo</li>

<hr>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/95">Cortex podcast</a> idea of yearly themes, 2019 was my <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/release">year of Release</a>. I think overall the theme served me well as I tried to keep releasing ideas, projects large and small throughout the year, regardless of what was happening around me, which admittedly was a lot.</p>
<p>Did I release everything that I wanted? In some cases I actually released more. In other respects I didn&rsquo;t achieve everything that I was hoping, but that is the point of the yearly theme. It&rsquo;s not a resolution, it&rsquo;s an idea to guide me through the year.</p>
<p>2020 is the year of <em>Consolidation</em> and will not have major new releases. Rather it will be building upon the blocks that I have established already - namely all things <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a> and everything on kaa.bz. I&rsquo;m excited for the coming year.</p>

			 <p>No idea why I keep doing this to myself. I’ve finally upgraded my phone from a 6S, which served me very faithfully for 4 years. This last month has been exceptionally rough as the battery on iOS 13 has made the phone practically unusable.</p>
<p>I went for the iPhone 11, as I am likely going to have to drop some more cash in the new year for a MacBook to replace my 6 year old brick with a broken logic board.</p>
<p>The size of this screen will take a little getting used to, but I’m sure I’ll get through that hardship 🤣.</p>
<p>So many great little features to appreciate, but to be honest it’s all about these cameras. It kinda reminds me of my beloved Kodak camera from over a decade ago. That camera was way ahead of its time. Hopefully this means I’ll start taking photos again.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a great number of people struggling with finding their voice online. They clearly want to have a presence online but don&rsquo;t know what to say, or more over they loose the momentum for themselves and end up reposting things or being <em>passive</em> clients scrolling and reading.</p>
<p>I know I had that exact same problem and I honestly think it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity. So here are two reasons why you should publish your voice online.</p>
<h2 id="a-gift-for-your-current-self">A Gift for Your Current Self</h2>
<p>The gift for your current self is really to help you develop a new skill. A skill that shows up regularly to do something for yourself. That lets you gain some clarity to your thoughts and your writing that is not meant for your own consumption. The most basic of skills is being able to write and communicate ideas. These skills are needed in every single walk of life. Having a personal site allows you to develop those skills day in and day out. Over time you will be able to get your point across faster and more succinctly.</p>
<h2 id="a-gift-for-your-future-self">A Gift for Your Future Self</h2>
<p>You might think that you are writing this website for others, but actually if others engage with it that&rsquo;s just a bonus. That should not be the reason you do this.</p>
<p>Rather, think of your personal site as a present you&rsquo;re giving yourself 5 years into the future. 10 years. 20 years. You are cataloguing events that meant something to you. Thoughts that were important to you at the time. It&rsquo;s a time capsule that you wrote and documented. You won&rsquo;t get to <em>really</em> enjoy and appreciate it till a little later.</p>
<p>One of the questions that is then asked is, why publish it at all? Why not just put it in any type of app for journaling. Different bucket. You fill every bucket differently. The type of things that you write on your site are thoughts, ideas, that you can enjoy in the future. Your journal are is there to try and help you work things out in your daily life. It&rsquo;s a fine line to walk, but once you have worked it out you&rsquo;ll appreciate that they are two different things.</p>

<p>It’s Ryan’s birthday today. He’s turned 2. I realised that I may not have written how he was born. Having only experienced his brother’s birth 3 years earlier, I was somewhat expecting a difficult affair. The hospital sent us back home a few times. When Yasmine was officially and totally done, we drove at a reasonable pace to the hospital where we were informed that she was really at the end. I ambled downstairs to the car, called my brother to tell him it was all about to begin and went upstairs.</p>
<p>Yasmine was getting in more pain very quickly. We were discussing epidurals (I was all in favour). Yasmine, as she is want to do, was questioning it all. The nurse patiently told us to wait as the doctor was around and she would come take a look and advise.  Doctor came, she was 8cm dilated (i.e. very close). No time for epidural, the baby was coming out very soon. 20 minutes later he was out.</p>
<p>It’s been a different adventure than what we went though with Zane but Ryan’s been a great baby, now a proper toddler.  Here’s to many more little guy.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/016">Issue 016</a> of my newsletter <em>In Abeyance</em> is out. I have found that I am oftentimes looking to the future and highlighting the road we need to take or make happen. In this issue, I want to bring some positive vibes and put the spotlight on where we have already made progress and projects that showcase built design at its best.</p>
<p>Next issue will be the last for 2019.</p>

			 <p>Took the wrong bloody train to the hotel didn’t I. Luckily it wasn’t so bad. I will say that I am really starting to appreciate Danish transportation elegance more and more.

		<a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2019/12/01/micro-fiction/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-01 06:18:00 -0500">Dec 1, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Writing <a href="/themark">The Mark</a> was a really interesting and unfamiliar process to me. First of all it was written as a narrative, while all my previous works of fiction were written as scripts intended for being made into comics. This was obviously a very different muscle that I had to use. For example I didn&rsquo;t know how to format dialogue (even though I&rsquo;ve thousands of line of dialogue), I ended up referring back to <a href="https://firstmanuscript.com/format-dialogue/">this page</a> time and time again throughout the month. Apart from the mechanics there is also a question of flow and structure. Two elements I really only considered in the most superficial manner. I will be revisiting the story to see what I did wrong and how I can improve.</p>
<p>One of the limitations I included (constraint is the mother of all creativity), was to the daily word count to around 50 words. This constraint allowed me to peck out the story predominantly on my iPhone. Every night after work I would take 5-10 minutes and just type something out. Having the bar so low meant that I was able to do achieve my goal every night, even when I was busy, or tired or had a headache.</p>
<p>As the process moved forward I finally realised that this was the perfect way to move several fiction ideas that I have had serious brain crack over. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to be doing. As an experiment I&rsquo;m going to see if I can move a story that I&rsquo;ve had in different stages, 50 words at a time. The thing is I also think that my site isn&rsquo;t really the perfect place to show the work as it progresses, rather to showcase completed chapters. So I&rsquo;ll be writing it on a service I&rsquo;ve been looking for the right project to try out. So I&rsquo;ll be running a <a href="http://buttondown.email/chroma">new newsletter</a> that has nothing in it but text (eventually a little logo) that I will hopefully publish to on a daily basis. Once a chapter is written then I’ll publish that on the site.</p>
<p>Why publish it at all? Part of it is building accountability and movement behind something that I otherwise won’t touch. It’s also a break that my creative brain needs in addition to the work that I carry out over on <a href="https://www.stet.build.">Stet.Build</a></p>

<li>Stepping back into the world Odysseus looked around for a suitable host. Ah, yes that one will do fine. Before he switched hosts, Odysseus planted one final message for Asteer to follow, ‘Find Helen of Troy. She is the key to what you are looking for.’ Odysseus then strode into the world un-tethered. While a dazed Asteer boarded the next glider that was heading back to the Mark.</li>

			 <p>Entering the mind of a spectre was a particularly disconcerting experience. You were subjected to a cacophony of whispers of every tone and intensity. Something was definitely not right. Asteer stood still. It was completely silent. He could no longer feel his gathen. In the distance he could make out silhouettes approaching him.</p>

			 <p>This November, as part of the <a href="http://www.micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> community, a series of prompts were published every day by <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2019/11/01/microblogvember.html">Jean</a>. My idea was to use some of these prompts and write a novella. The constraint was to remain with roughly 50 words per day. I have allowed myself the opportunity to go back and edit previous instalments as the story develops.</p>
<p>I will hopefully collate them all with a few sketches. Today is the halfway point of the story, so if you want to catch up, head over to the <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/categories/mark">dedicated category page</a></p>

			 <p>The Mark was created to be where ideas were farmed from the greatest minds that ever existed. Rules were created to ensure that none of the spectres had any illusions that they were in control. As expected, some couldn’t accept that. This had lead to organised culls being used as an example to deter others.</p>

			 <p>Today I had my first disappointment in Copenhagen. I’ve been collecting my paper, cans, plastic and glass to take to the recycling bins. Sadly near our house, I could only find a location for paper and glass bottles. When I opened the paper bin, it was filled with regular rubbish.</p>
<p>My Danish colleagues inform me that this is certainly not the case throughout the city (or country) and that sometimes it does differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. It broke my heart a little bit because if they can’t get recycling right in Copenhagen, then honestly what chance does the rest of humanity stand?</p>

			 <p>I’ve now been in Copenhagen for a week and have had a tiny bit of time to get a feel for the city. The closest city I can compare this to is London. However I keep reminding myself that this is not the UK, things are <em>decidedly</em> different here. The best example I can think of was when I was walking, I take a turn off the main high street, onto what looked like a simple residential area, and there at the end of the road I could see the wind turbines<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It was just another reminder, things are different here. However, the biggest difference that I can gather is the city’s approach to transport.</p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<p>The truth is though the city’s layout is different, the streets are wider. They have very distinct lanes for the different modes of transport. The lack of total dependence on the car is absolutely evident here. Every form of transport has been catered to in one form or another. Walking, cycling, scooters, boats, metro, train, buses and even the ‘humble’ car. The first few days I spent walking. That’s because this simple act of taking a long walk and watching what’s going on in the world has been an exercise that I have not been able to do over these last decade(?!). The Gulf is many things, but a haven and promoter for walkers it is not.</p>
<p>Most telling for me is that I’m about to have walked more in the month of October, than any other month over the last year (according to my iPhone, which is missing a great deal of steps I know, but I’m using it as a loose indicator).</p>
<p>I’m now also looking very closely at buying a Segway Ninebot Kickscooter as a fun and simple way to get around town. While there are scooters everywhere for hire, the cost adds up really quickly (by my calculation use the scooter for 140 trips and you’ve paid off the scooter). That’s the other thing about <a href="https://www.stet.build/is/013">micromobility</a>, it’s generally really affordable, even if you have to replace the scooter relatively regularly - it’s a utility cost more than anything.</p>
<h2 id="local-not-global-country">Local Not Global Country</h2>
<p>The other element that is clear here is the fact that this is not a Global city. There are no Amazon Prime trucks running around. There isn’t a MacDonalds or Starbucks on every corner (although these two staples do exist here). There is no Apple store. Vodaphone doesn’t operate here (at least I haven’t seen the Vodaphone logo anywhere). And so it goes. In this regard, it feels like a place caught in time&hellip;with it’s own home brands, made by and catering it’s own people. Some companies I’ve never heard of before, others have actually made the leap outside these borders.</p>
<p>Over the last 8 years, the word ‘local’ was seen as a bit of a derogative term. Somehow, local here is celebrated, as it’s the main part of your every day life. It’s another part that I will need to recalibrate my thinking.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>Since arriving in Copenhagen, I’ve eaten at one restaurant and it was a magnificent. The one thing that I do have to say is that the produce here is exceptional. I knew that strawberries here have a good reputation, but I didn’t expect that. Bringing the shopping into my apartment, I could smell them straight away. I haven’t smelt a strawberry in so long.</p>
<p>Buying local chicken, local tomatoes, berries, have all really elevated my meals considerably. I’ve been getting more and more into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JamieOliver">Jamie Oliver’s Food Tube</a> channel as well and have been really loving it.</p>
<h2 id="language-barrier">Language Barrier</h2>
<p>I knew that this would be a thing. I’ve not gotten into a habit yet for listening and doing my Danish lessons but I do intend to do incorporate into my life very very soon.</p>

			 <p>So I finally tried a bicycle today (courtesy of <a href="https://www.donkey.bike/">Donkey Republic</a>). I don’t want to recall how long it’s been since I’ve ridden a bike, but it was fun&hellip;except after 50min I was pretty hot. On the other side of things, offering far less value for money was the Lime scooter. While it was quick and easy, I didn’t love the ride (it was a little too bumpy) but I can certainly see the appeal in the city - will definitely be trying it again. Also, I’m convincing myself why I wouldn’t order a <a href="https://swapfiets.dk/en/">Swapfiets</a> (which unlike the Donkey bike, seriously looks amazing with the blue tire).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2019/09/28/microblog-feature-request/">Micro.blog Feature Request</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2019/09/28/microblog-feature-request/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-09-28 13:36:00 -0500">Sep 28, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is the second edition of the Micro.blog feature request post. Last year, <a href="http://www.kaa.bz/2018/11/19/missing-from-microblog.html">I reviewed</a> what I hoped Micro.blog would add to the service. <a href="https://micro.blog/Manton">@Manton</a> and co have had a very, very busy this year, so this isn’t to diminish all the work they’ve done. Rather these are a list of features that I would like to see included into the platform at some point.</p>
<h2 id="canonical-website">Canonical Website</h2>
<p>All these features unfortunately haven’t made it into the service. Although we’ve drafts have been added, I do have one additional feature I wanted added:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let me filter the type of posts from people I follow. So if I want to see everyone’s photos then let me do that. Let me see everyone’s podcasts. Sure you can do something similar from the discover section, but that’s everyone (?) on the platform.</li>
<li>It would be nice to see how many responses have been made on any individual post. Could be a small little number next to the ‘conversation’ link.</li>
<li>Allow more than one photo to be uploaded at a time.</li>
<li>Highlight the emojis that are supported on the platform directly underneath and allow you to insert them from there.</li>
<li>Once drafts are saved, they can’t all be found in a single list, they become part of the entire stream. Also drafts don’t show up in the official iOS apps.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>
<p>Totally nailed this feature request.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>Photos should be showcased on a grid of three squares across. Ideally this should be another standard page found at mydomain/photos.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>I’ve asked for this before, I’ll ask for it again. I want to know how many posts I’ve written. How many photos. A histogram of my posting to get a feel for when and how often I post. How many replies have I made?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would love to see a yearly view of the number of posts I’ve made on a month by month basis. Each month could have two bars showing how much stuff gets posted to my site and how much stuff is interaction with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="better-theme-control">Better theme control.</h2>
<p>A year ago we were limited to tweaking CSS. Now we have a LOT more power behind us. So the initial request was completed&hellip;<em>however</em> I’ll be that guy. While I’ve sorted my design for the foreseeable future, apart from the occasional colour tweak, I don’t intend to change my design while I’m on Micro.blog. Partly because I’ve spent a <em>ton</em> of time on it as it is. Partly because the manner in which I make these changes is pretty cumbersome. It should be easier than it is, especially for someone not technical.</p>
<p><em>Bonus related feature: I don’t think that theming in general is easy on the web. A proper feature changer is to be able to design your site in a block type editor.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>I initially used to love the fact that I was limited in what I could do which was to play around with the CSS and that was it. Since then the addition of updating the footer has been added. A great additions for sure, but I want full control of my site. I’m paying for hosting, eventually I’d like to be allowed to control the whole look of my site.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="subscription">Subscription</h2>
<p>Yup. Sorted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>This is finally being offered, but not officially (blink that reply and it’s gone)? I’d like to see a yearly subscription to the service become official.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="two-streams">Two Streams</h2>
<p>Not yet, but something tells me that this is on the docket very soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>Micro.blog by it’s nature has two streams. The first is your website stream, and only includes your posts, while the second stream is the social one that includes everyone you follow and your posts starting with an @ symbol. As a user both are important, yet they are given wildly different treatment.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
<p>There has been some movement on this, with the addition of new icons. However it’s not as granular as I would want it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are currently 9 categories that you can contribute towards. It’s a good start, but hardly what I’d call comprehensive. I’d like to see a great deal more categories. Architecture, Engineering, Comics, Stationary, Country-specific-categories, and the list goes on.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="faster-updating">Faster Updating</h2>
<p><del>I use <a href="https://www.blot.im">Blot</a> for my other website, <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a>. What I’ve noticed is that updating anything using that system is <em>instant</em>. That includes posts, css design, etc. I’d like some of that updating speed on Micro.blog if that’s possible (maybe I’m asking too much).</del></p>
<p>I recently had to update a few things on my CSS (it was for this post actually) and it actually seemed to me that Manton has sorted the original slow gremlins that impacted the design control, so scratch this item of the list as well.</p>

			 <p>This is interesting. I’m now being forced into living the iPad lifestyle as my main computing device (until I can revive my Mac or worse replace it).</p>
<p>Let’s see if <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/">Federico is onto something</a> with his commitment and enjoyment of the iPad as his favourite device. I haven’t really had to do this on account of having a Mac. I found what I believed the iPad was ideal for - everything involving the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>It’s going to be interesting to write, research, edit and draw several issues of <a href="http://www.stet.build/">my newsletter</a> on this device. Unfortunately I’ve still not switched to iPadOS, so the experience does feel <em>somewhat</em> hindered and limited at the moment.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the only app that doesn’t have an iOS equivalent has a <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com/">web version</a> available, everything else I use has a fully functional iOS app.</p>

The irony of course is I&rsquo;ll have to rent a car till I leave Dubai - it&rsquo;s impossible (or exceptionally expensive) to function here without one.</p>

			 <p>I sold my desk today. When I first moved to Dubai I decided to treat myself. I got myself a big ass desk that I could spread my stuff across and generally <em>embrace</em> the clutter. Now that we’re on our way to Denmark I’m going to have to downsize.</p>
<p>Having said that I have learnt to embrace the digital a little bit more. Sure I still have room in my life for some paper (namely my journal and pocket notebooks), but I think overall it’s going to be about getting by with <em>less stuff</em>.</p>

			 <p>Just finished listening to <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/built-on-sand/">episode 361</a> of <em>99% Invisible</em>.

<p>The interview with Vince Beiser was <em>excellent</em>. Sadly they beat me to the topic on sand - to be fair Vince was way, way ahead of me on that one.  He does an amazing job of explaining the premise of his book, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Grain-Story-Transformed-Civilization/dp/0399576428">The World in a Grain</a>, which I can&rsquo;t wait to read.</p>

			 <p>40 today.</p>
<p>I spent the first 20 years riding my bike. Listening to grunge. Learning how to draw. Reading comics.</p>
<p>The next 10 years I spent learning about graphic design, the web and talking about make comics.</p>
<p>The last 10 years were spent actually making some comics and learning to be both a husband and father. At some point I gave up on putting my energy into comics.</p>
<p>Instead I’ve embraced putting all my energies into an endeavour that brings together all of the things that I love under one roof.

			 <p>One of the happier occurrences that has happened, in spite of all the disruption a move brings, is being a happy member of the circular economy.

<p>I&rsquo;ve scanned several of these (maybe half), but really don&rsquo;t have the heart to part ways with them. I know that I likely will <em>never</em> look at them again, except maybe as an exercise in nostalgia. Knowing that, do I keep them in a digital form only?

I just had my car registered and the RTA process gives you the details of your carbon over the last year. At 23%, that’s around 11 tons of carbon. The real number however was 3.4 tons, which implies to me that this calculator is off.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">calculator</a> offers a far more granular experience. Allows you to understand how that big number actually adds up. The curious thing however is how different the country averages are between the calculators. The UN calculator seems to imply it’s 93.21 tons/year, while this calculator thinks that the UAE average is 23.3 tons/year. Someone is telling <em>porkies</em>.</p>

My reading focus has shifted to philosophy, marketing, engineering and architecture. It&rsquo;s funny how one goes through different phases in their life.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday my youngest and I turned off the lights and looked up into the sky at the moon. Ryan is completely fascinated by this changing object in the sky. I’m even considering buying a telescope just for him to experience it in a whole new way.  Not sure how ambitious it is for a 1½ year old to grasp what he’d be looking at.</p>
<p>With only 1 week to go before it’s been 50 years since Apollo 11 landed on the moon, I’ve been slowly immersing myself in all things moon related. Really looking forward to the Todd Douglas documentary,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCWnLhBE6hw">here’s the trailer</a>. The <a href="http://bbcworldservice.com/13minutes">13 Minutes to the Moon</a> podcast has been an incredible audio journey. Meanwhile the amazing Lego sets that have been released for the <a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-US/product/LEGO-NASA-Apollo-Saturn-V-21309">Saturn V</a> and <a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-US/product/NASA-Apollo-11-Lunar-Lander-10266">Lunar Excursion Module (LEM)</a> are top of my wishlist at the moment.</p>
<p>Finally, here’s a really old (and pretty rough) cartoon I drew 6 years ago now, when Neil Armstrong died.

			 <p>Happy to report that <em>Justified</em> is in fact excellent. That being said the first few episodes were not great (felt like bad episodic television). Acting and characters were awesome. The stories were not. However once you got past the 4th episode it all started coming together.</p>

<p>I consider my life online across three distinct stints. The first ran been 2004 to around 2010. In that time I wrote around 1800 posts, many long form articles. The second stint was across 2010 and 2017, which I refer to as the <em>nomad</em> years. I meandered from platform to platform, changing the reason for writing with every move. The third stint began last year and with it brought much needed focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to publish 680 new posts (the rest where stuff I imported from Instagram and a handful of posts from Medium). During this time, I was rediscovering my writing muscle. Rediscovering how to write online again. And most importantly, rediscovering <em>why</em> I should post online. I&rsquo;ve been writing more consistently online than ever before - usually it seems that I don’t go more than a few days before getting the itch. Going forward I really hope that I start writing more about the process of writing and drawing for my online publications over at <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been writing online in some form or another since 2001. Around 2004, blogging really took off and there was a period in time where the <em>system</em> was more important than what was written. Over the years I&rsquo;ve meandered from one system to another. What I&rsquo;ve now realised is that the system has a major influence on the type of things that I end up posting. <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is a truly excellent <em>system</em> for posts that run around the 200-400 word range. It&rsquo;s great for posting single images. It&rsquo;s likely pretty good for podcasts and a single video as well (I don&rsquo;t have any experience for these types of posts yet). Where it fails is anything beyond the confines of those walls <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The reason? Friction.</p>
<p>If you wanted to write something a little longer, the system lets you. It even allows you to add a title if you want (you may <em>not</em> want, Micro.blog doesn&rsquo;t judge).  You want to add an image to that post? Go ahead but you have no say in where that image gets added (until after you publish). Friction. You want to add multiple images? Sure, but go to the upload section and then copy paste the link and add your image tags around it all. Friction. You want to edit something? Sure, but it takes a while to load <em>Posts</em> &gt; <em>Edit</em>. Friction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is wrong, I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s a thing to bear in mind. What all these little friction points do is allow the software to set a tone. You want to do anything more taxing? You&rsquo;re going to need to work a little bit harder. Which more than likely means that you won&rsquo;t. The <em>system</em> plays a part, consciously or subconsciously.</p>

<p>Here is the test: You have spent some time with this person, either you have a drink or go for dinner or you go to a ball game. it doesn’t matter very much but at the end of that time you observe whether you are more energized or less energized. Whether you are tired or whether you are exhilarated. if you are more tired then you have been poisoned.
if you have more energy you have been nourished. The test is almost infallible and i suggest that you use it for the rest of your life.<br>

			 <p>A year ago today, while fighting my own demons from a professional disappointment earlier in the year, my mind was searching for a project to put my energy behind. I&rsquo;d sleepwalked through evening and was feeling a little deflated. After grabbing a shower, I put my head on my pillow and like a bolt of lightning the idea was in my head. Formed. Galvanised.</p>
<p>I looked excitedly at my wife. Fast asleep. I quickly rushed back to my room and started scribbling the very first ideas in fear that when I wake up the next morning it would be gone. There was literally no chance of that happening. The force was strong with this one.</p>
<p>Over the next month I would be using a wall to throw as many ideas as possible on there. The crux of it all would be a vehicle to allow me to do all the things that I loved to do and that I&rsquo;d spent the better part of my adult life doing. That is engineering, graphic design and illustration.</p>
<p>I began sharing the starts of this journey at the start of 2019 over at <a href="https://www.stet.build">Stet.Build</a>. The first output being my monthly newsletter <em>In Abeyance</em>. It&rsquo;s been an amazingly productive year to go from that initial idea to something a little more tangible.</p>

Thankfully user <a href="https://twitter.com/LukBukkit">LukBukkit</a>&rsquo;s JS-FU is strong. He&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/LukBukkit/chartist-plugin-tooltip">updated the plugin</a> and works as intended.

			 <p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve done regularly (and seen other do themselves) is trying the <strong>macro</strong> thing before having begun the <strong>micro</strong> thing. As though it&rsquo;s a given that you can sit down and bang out a novel, draw a graphic novel or run a marathon. You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Start <em>micro</em> in everything that you do. When something becomes overwhelming for you, revert to the micro. Make it small and insignificant. Make it easy. The eventual output will absolutely surprise and delight you in ways that doing the same in smaller sittings won&rsquo;t. The reason is that you do it with very little effort. It was easy. And because it was easy, you can conceive of the future where you continue down this same path.</p>
<p>If you want to write, sing, exercise, draw, read, then do these things, in laughably small chunks, as little as 2 minutes. Every single day. At the same time. Stacked against something you already do.</p>
<p>You go to sleep every day? Great, 5 minutes before that make sure to read one page of a book. Drive to work every day? Great, when you reach work, pull out your journal and write for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the greatest lesson I learnt from reading <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> and has really been a revelation for me. You should try it yourself.</p>

Jacinda Ardern&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZC3_P-NcIg">response was anything but</a>.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finally finished <em>Atomic Habits</em>. Great book that I’m actually running through again to try and see how I can best benefit from all the wisdom inside it’s covers. I’ve managed to tweak some of my behaviours such that I am journaling every day without fail. I’m also hoping to get 30min writing ever morning before the day really starts. Tidying up the kitchen before putting the kids to bed. Flossing. The big one I am struggling with is the daily exercise.</p>

			 <p>Barak Obama never affected my life directly, however he existed in a world I understood <em>politically</em>. A world that showed what a <em>leader</em> could be. From any country. I miss the impact the right person has on the political landscape. The world deserves more.</p>

		<a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2019/03/08/k/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-03-08 13:11:42 -0500">Mar 8, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently bought the K380 keyboard from Logitech. Originally intended to be used as a replacement for the generic Dell POS that is supplied at work, I can certainly see a place for this keyboard elsewhere in my life. The keys have weight to them. It has <em>gravitas</em>. A satisfying thumping sound that I am usually not used to on my MacBook Pro. It’s not that the MacBook Pro is a bad experience&hellip;far from it. It’s just that this Logitech keyboard offers a different experience that I really like.</p>
<p>Of course one of the annoying things about a wireless keyboard (as least the really minimal looking ones) is the fact that they are typically not backlit. Once you get used to that kind of feature, it’s actually pretty difficult to get used to living without it. The only other area that I would comment on is the fact that the key markings are not seamless with the plastic of the buttons. They are trying to meld into the keys, except they really don’t.</p>
<p>If you’re in the market for something relatively cheap that feels more expensive than it actually is, and that you’re touching all the time, the K380 is an excellent choice. Also it comes in a range of pretty funky colours, so as a minimum it will add colour to your desk.</p>

			 <p>Disconnecting from the internet until such time as it suits you is empowering. Just because we can have the internet at our fingertips doesn’t mean we should use it.  unfortunately most of us will succumb to the defaults. A browser, an RSS reader, social media, our websites. All these things contribute to noise in our heads. Some noise is good but under our terms and when we choose to give away that attention.</p>
<p>I’ve found the last few days without these distractions on my phone incredibly enlightening. My phone has gone from a tool of <em>consumption</em> to one of predominant <em>creation</em>.</p>
<p>In fact the only thing that I consume is books on my Kindle. An app that has unfortunately languished in a folder to be opened ever so sporadically.
I’ve also dusted off my <em>actual</em> Kindle and have been using it more often as a consequence. Reading and writing more on any device is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I also find myself more in the <em>moment</em> with my kids. My wife would forever complain about me not &lsquo;being there mentally&rsquo; and she was probably right. By contrast, these days, most evenings I don&rsquo;t even know where I put my phone when it&rsquo;s time to go to bed (usually at the entrance from when I came home).</p>
<p>I honestly encourage everyone to give it a go. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how little you actually miss out on.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was the first day that I put my phone in <em>tool</em> mode. Effectively everything that is a stream (including Micro.blog) has been deleted. Reeder? Gone. Safari? Gone (ok hidden but nowhere to be seen). Email? Gone. Notifications? Gone.</p>
<p>The upside is that I now pick up my phone 50 times less on average and 1 hour less.</p>
<p>So what do I use my phone for now? As it turns out, a fair amount.</p>
<ol>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Mifit tracking</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
<li>Scanner</li>
<li>Timezone clock</li>
<li>Kindle</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Text messaging</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I go to my apps and it&rsquo;s with purpose. I&rsquo;m not going in for the sake of going in. Doing so means I&rsquo;m more <strong>available</strong> in the moment. When I check my emails, I go in, have a look and then move onto something else. It was a pretty scary feeling at first, but now that I&rsquo;ve done this, I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s taken me this long.</p>

			 <p>⭐ A year ago, on the <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2018/01/16/its-always-hard.html">16th of January 2018</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always hard to start something new. The main question is whether or not you’ll see things through and actually find value and continue to use it as the initial shine wears off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was my first post on <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. 475 posts later, I&rsquo;m glad to say that I have derived incredible value from the service.</p>
<p>I think the main reason can be attributed to it&rsquo;s frictionless posting. The <strong>box</strong> doesn&rsquo;t judge - you decide how short or long you want to write, add a title or not it&rsquo;s up to you. It doesn&rsquo;t offer any complications - no categories, tags, dates or URL naming. Just write and hit post.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the service has helped me take complete control of my online presence. Everything is now funnelled into <a href="http://kaa.bz">kaa.bz</a>.</p>

			 <p>In 2019 I plan to finally start sending out a newsletter that I&rsquo;ve been working on for around 6 months now. The start of this idea actually extends much further back than that, but I suppose now is the right time to ship.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a> app has been a true revelation to me.</p>
<p>The app gives me the tools to take control of my editing. My original document captures my <em>raw</em> ideas and thoughts. When imported into Hemingway, the document becomes refined and hopefully, more pleasant to read. What I love about this approach is that it&rsquo;s a puzzle I&rsquo;m trying to solve, one sentence at a time.</p>
<p>If you have any long form piece of writing, I <strong>highly recommend</strong> this app.</p>
<p>This is best illustrated by comparing the summary sections of the same document.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I don’t like to write about <em>the system</em> I’m using but I thought it would be good to check in a couple of times a year and see the lay of the land.</p>
<p>Micro.blog is a personal online publishing platform with a social layer built in. It differs from other publishing platforms in a few key ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It actively encourages you to use your own domain name.</li>
<li>It’s simple to publish.</li>
<li>For some it is a paid service.</li>
<li>It provides you with <strong>some</strong> stats.</li>
<li>It provides you with <strong>some</strong> control of what your site looks like.</li>
<li>The social element is managed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that Micro.blog handles many issues in a wonderfully elegant fashion. However there is plenty of room for improvement. While I’m aware that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> is but one person who is already doing a lot, it’s important to recognise that the sustainable thing is to have more than one person involved in the ongoing development of the platform, dare I say <em>multiple</em> people. To help him get to that ideal, the hosted option <strong>needs</strong> to become more appealing.</p>
<h2 id="the-canonical-app">The Canonical App</h2>
<p>I’m not going to focus on any of the apps that have been made for Micro.blog (official or third party), as I see these as nice to haves. For me the canonical view is the one presented at the website. This is the view that <em>everyone</em> on the platform shares (regardless of operating system). I think overall the simplicity of this interface is what makes things work.</p>
<p>Items that I would like to see included at some point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let me filter the type of posts from people I follow. So if I want to see everyone’s photos then let me do that. Let me see everyone’s podcasts. Sure you can do something similar from the discover section, but that’s everyone (?) on the platform.</li>
<li>It would be nice to see how many responses have been made on any individual post. Could be a small little number next to the ‘conversation’ link.</li>
<li>Allow more than one photo to be uploaded at a time.</li>
<li>Highlight the emojis that are supported on the platform directly underneath and allow you to insert them from there.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>
<p>Photos should be showcased on a grid of three squares across. Ideally this should be another standard page found at <em>mydomain/photos</em>**.**</p>
<p>Micro.blog already is able to distinguish photos pretty well. Let me see my photos in a gallery. It’s one of the feature that made me stick with Instagram for as long as I did.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>Micro.blog does not, by design, show the number of users that follow you. My view on stats is that as this site is focused on my words and pictures, then my stats should also focus on this output.</p>
<p>I would love to see a yearly view of the number of posts I’ve made on a month by month basis. Each month could have two bars showing how much stuff gets posted to my site and how much stuff is interaction with others.</p>
<p>Additional stats could highlight the total number of photos, posts and interactions. What is the number of people I am following (I can see this in the iOS app but not on the web).</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. It’s gamifying the experience. Except I’m now in competition with my previous self.</p>
<h2 id="subscription">Subscription</h2>
<p>This is <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/1057209">finally being offered</a>, but not <em>officially</em> (blink that reply and it’s gone)? I’d like to see a yearly subscription to the service become official.</p>
<h2 id="two-streams">Two Streams</h2>
<p>Micro.blog by it’s nature has two streams. The first is your website stream, and only includes your posts, while the second stream is the social one that includes everyone you follow and your posts starting with an @ symbol. As a user both are important, yet they are given wildly different treatment.</p>
<p>Your contributions to the conversation are still your words. These are currently only found in <em>micro.blog/yourusername.</em> I would say that these should either be allowed to be ‘published’ to your blog as part of your stream or captured in a separate page with a link back to the original conversation.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I initially used to love the fact that I was limited in what I could do which was to play around with the CSS and that was it. Since then the addition of updating the footer has been added. A great additions for sure, but I want full control of my site. I’m paying for hosting, eventually I’d like to be allowed to control the whole look of my site.</p>
<p>I recognise that this is likely a much more involved design change, but it’s one that I think is important to provide as an option, so that there isn’t a pretty fundamental reason to go self host and attach an RSS feed in.</p>
<h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
<p>There are currently 9 categories that you can contribute towards. It’s a good start, but hardly what I’d call comprehensive. I’d like to see a great deal more categories. Architecture, Engineering, Comics, Stationary, Country-specific-categories, and the list goes on.</p>

			 <p>My wife is forever loosing her iPhone. <strong>Top tip</strong>. If you login from another device on iCloud (and assuming the phone is still got power and connected to the internet) you can cause it to ring, even if it&rsquo;s put on mute. So awesome.</p>

			 <p>After listen to <em>The Minimalists</em> on the <a href="https://www.kevinrose.com">Kevin Rose</a> show, I came to a realisation. In my persuit to determine which iPhone I should be buying this year, it turns out I really don&rsquo;t need to get one after all.</p>
<p>The reason for upgrading isn&rsquo;t because the phone is slow, lacks some essential feature or that certain apps don&rsquo;t run on it. Rather the <strong>only</strong> reason to upgrade is for the camera.</p>
<p>Except I already own a pretty decent camera, the NEX-F3. I bought it just before Zane was born (so a little over 4 years ago now) and seem to have stopped using it 2 years ago. Why? I&rsquo;m not sure. Maybe I bought into the whole &lsquo;the best camera is the one on you&rsquo; ideaology?</p>
<p>A quick read of a Wirecutter <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/first-sony-e-mount-lenses-to-buy/">article I bookmarked in 2013</a>, led me to circling onto several Sigma lens that will help me get better photos. The bonus to all this is that they&rsquo;re at a pretty reduced price point at the moment. And while we&rsquo;re here, we might as well talk about one of <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/2013/12/11/how-to-take-good-photos-for-under-1000.html">my favourite article</a> about photography to brush up on some things.</p>

			 <p>The plastic I use in my life is really starting to grate on me in a bad way. To me it signals a lack of progress, in many ways, for a race who excells at creating problems and then solving them. The <a href="https://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/hi-107-one-year-of-weird">latest episode</a> of <em>Hello Internet</em> highlighted that we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>In it CGP Grey claims that the UK government reviewed the impact of plastic bags when compared to other kinds of bags and that the cloth totes require 20,000 uses to become more sustainable. The document he was probably referring to was <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291023/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf">this one here</a>, from the executive summary a very handy table is given:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type of carrier</th>
<th>HDPE bag (No secondary reuse)</th>
<th>HDPE bag (40.3% reused as bin liners)</th>
<th>HDPE bag (100% reused as bin liners)</th>
<th>HDPE bag (Used 3 times)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Paper bag</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LDPE bag</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Non-woven PP bag</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>26</td>
<td>33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cotton bag</td>
<td>131</td>
<td>173</td>
<td>327</td>
<td>393</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Sure, still a decent number of times that each type of bag needs to be reused, but a far cry from 20,000. I certainly use my bags at least 100 times a year, and have had them for 3 1/2 years so far&hellip;.they could last for <strong>many many</strong> years to come.</p>

		<div class="e-content">

<p>On the weekend we drove up to the Shouf Biosphere Reserve. The only regret I have is that we didn&rsquo;t even come close to experiencing the true majesty of the place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing these things down to make the most out of any future visits as the human brain will forget everything eventually.</p>
<h2 id="for-kids">For Kids</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I had shown Zane a picture of the &lsquo;supposed&rsquo; turtles that can be found in the reserve&hellip;as a complete lover of animals (I&rsquo;m pretty sure he gets this from his mother), the poor little guy spent his entire time trying to find one while he was there. So top tip, don&rsquo;t show pictures of animals.</p>
<p>My baby boy Ryan loved being surrounded by trees. Like absolutely loved it in a way only a baby can feel excited about something new and natural and pure, because it&rsquo;s the closest thing to him in that sense.</p>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<p>I think the people behind the reserve have done a great job of the website and the overall information provided. The <a href="http://shoufcedar.org">Shouf Cedar website</a> is probably one of the best site&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve seen in Lebanon. Sure it&rsquo;s a WordPress affair, but it&rsquo;s done in a tasteful manner. Make sure to take the time and run through all the information on the site to make the most out of your trip.</p>
<p>I genuinely liked the logo for the whole reserve and really loved the tickets you buy at the entrance to the reserve.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="entrances">Entrances</h2>
<p>We ended up going through the Barouk entrance. While a lovely entrance, clearly not the main entrance, which is the Massar. However, there are no less than six entrances:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maassar El Chouf</li>
<li>Barouk</li>
<li>Ain Zhlata/Bmohray</li>
<li>Mrosti</li>
<li>Niha</li>
<li>Aammiq</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a handy map, that if you squint hard enough you&rsquo;ll think is Lebanon, don&rsquo;t be fooled (like I was the first time), that&rsquo;s a map of the reserve itself. Once you get through the entrances, you have to travel around 5km into the reserve, park your car/bus and then you get to choose your hiking trail.</p>
<h2 id="eating">Eating</h2>
<p><em>Obviously</em> don&rsquo;t expect to be able to eat anywhere in the reserve. I honestly didn&rsquo;t consider this clearly. My suggestion is to basically either bring a good old honest picnic with you and eat at the entrance of the actual reserve (there are picnic benches) with a great view.</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect any 3G/LTE signal while you&rsquo;re up there. If you&rsquo;re going to be dependant on technology to get you to places, make sure that it can work offline. The website lets you download GPS maps as well.</p>

			 <p>While it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you&rsquo;re writing on your website for the &lsquo;internet&rsquo;, the truth of the matter is that you&rsquo;re actually writing these things and obsessing about it&rsquo;s design primarily and sometimes exclusively for yourself.</p>
<p>These words are a snapshot in time. Of where you were and what you were doing. They might be reflections on what happened in your day or what&rsquo;s currently captured your imagination.</p>
<p>Why not just write this in a journal you say? Because &lsquo;publishing&rsquo; something on a site provides a level of finality. A level of accomplishment that a mere text file in a folder, or a journal entry in your notebook doesn&rsquo;t provide. Not that there is anything wrong with either of those approaches, rather the online published version is <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>One of my favourite new feature/plugins on <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is ability to <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories">create an &lsquo;on-this-day&rsquo; page</a> that collects your past posts that happened&hellip;.erm, on this day.</p>
<p>The reason it&rsquo;s so great is that it&rsquo;s another clear tool, made for you. It&rsquo;s made to allow you to reflect on what you&rsquo;ve written in the past and what you were thinking 1, 2, 3 or more years ago. If you&rsquo;re not <em>using</em> this feature, then you&rsquo;re missing out on one of the joys about blogging, which is reflecting on what you&rsquo;ve written.</p>

			 <p>Since April I have been working silently and diligently on my little project. I&rsquo;ve still got a long while to go before I&rsquo;m happy to share what&rsquo;s been going on with me but I wanted to share my absolute recommendation for <a href="http://www.ia.net/writer">iAWriter</a> as one of the best tools for writing projects ever made.</p>
<p>Of significant value to me is the ability to link in multiple text files into a single document. This has allowed me to reorganise the entire project several times over, as though it was a simple deck of cards.</p>
<p>This feature alone would be enough for me, but that is just the start of things. It&rsquo;s super lightweight and opens instantly. It doesn&rsquo;t have any font features (except choosing between a single font) and that helps me from wasting type. Although there arent' many templates to choose from, the basic ones included with the app do an amazing job of typesetting the work in a fashion that I can read/markup and edit freely.</p>
<p>Sure I would like a few features found in the <a href="https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/">Highland</a> app, such as sprint timer, native fountain support, and actual <em>comment</em> support within the document, but this app provides me with so much and I highly recommend you consider it for your next project.</p>

			 <p>One of the single most powerful things that I hope to teach my kids, is to understand and appreciate the concept of consistent &amp; incremental. This applies to aspects of themselves and in everything around them. As long as you <strong>increment</strong> on a thing you&rsquo;re working on and <strong>consistently</strong> show up every day you will eventually see results.</p>
<p>The hardest part is to percevier in the face of no visible improvement and keep moving forward. Set your course because you know it is true and try and remain on it.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been 3½ years since I came to Lebanon. I&rsquo;d like to say that things have changed here, but they really haven&rsquo;t. The poor and tired infrastructure has been left in complete disrepair and it&rsquo;s crumbling. Creaking under it&rsquo;s own weight. The lack of town planning and proper governmental checks and balances continues to produce&hellip;ugliness.</p>
<p>The situation has been exacerbated by the influx of Syrian refugees. The sectarian wars that used to be played out in Lebanon have now achieved a much larger platform in Syria and the evil has spread far and wide. 12M displaced people and a whole generation of children being raised in poor conditions.</p>
<p>My fear is that if the situation doesn&rsquo;t improve in a meaningful way, this region will only get worse and wars will eventually play out on an even larger scale. The region has been ripped apart for over 60 years, one country at a time (Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen have all fallen). Who&rsquo;s next?</p>

			 <p>I’ve now been wearing the <a href="https://www.mi.com/en/miband2/">Mi Band 2</a> for a couple of months. The data has given me the agency to <em>try</em> and change my nature tendencies.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly the most useful metric I&rsquo;ve found is sleep logging. When did I go to sleep? When did I wake up? How long was my deep sleep for - that&rsquo;s the good kind of sleep right? Right?</p>
<p>Sleep or the lack of it definitely is what affects me the most throughout my day - I might eat more or less, I might have a headache or not.</p>
<p>The behaviour that I was hoping for the most influence is the amount of exercise I carry out. This is still an ongoing project as I need to carve the correct time in my schedule to do the exercise. <strong>Operation summer</strong> is going to try and finally get into shape.</p>

			 <p>⚽ Notes on the Iceland vs Nigeria game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hoping Iceland pull an equaliser against Nigeria, along with Mexico they&rsquo;re my two favourite <em>underdog</em> teams.</li>
<li>How the hell did Nigeria just score twice in 20 minutes? Where Argentina had no way in?</li>
<li>VAR comes to their rescue&hellip;and he hoofs the penalty. What is going on with the penalties this World Cup?</li>
<li>Argentina can actually make it through to the next round now, after their abysmal performance yesterday to Croatia.</li>
<li>Both goals by Musa are some of the best <em>individual</em> performance goals I&rsquo;ve seen in the world cup. Didn&rsquo;t think they had it in them to be honest.</li>
<li>A great second half in this game, makes this group qualifying a fascinating one to watch.</li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never been one to look up to people as role models and yet this quote, from Seneca, has stuck with me these last few days:</p>

<p>There is a need, in my view, for someone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to do it against you won&rsquo;t make the crooked straight.<br>

			 <p>📚 I <em>finally</em> finished a book this year, Michael Chabon&rsquo;s <em>Manhood for Amateurs</em>. The book was written back in 2009 (which I believe is now being followed up with a sequel of sorts) and was the right book to read, as the words have resonated with me, as a newly minted father of a second son.</p>
<p>I started it around the time my Ryan was born and it&rsquo;s taken me 6 months to complete these 300 pages. I love to read, but <strong>clearly</strong> I don&rsquo;t carve enough time to carry the action out. My reading has been pretty scattered across multiple books that I never seem to finish. I&rsquo;m hoping this signals a return to a more regular reading pattern.</p>
<p>What I also realised was that I&rsquo;m not happy with how I&rsquo;m reading. Or more accurately, the lack of taking notes or capturing the most interesting parts of books I read.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some key quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is a form of exploration, of sailing off into the unknown alone, heading for those unmarked places on the map. If children are not permitted - not taught - to be adventurers and explorers as children, what will become of the world of adventure, of stories, of literature itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why else had they done it - built it all up so they could then knock it all down? After a marriage breaks, there is nothing more pointless than the child, to that child, of that marriage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The song has to take you by surprise, catch you when your guard is down, when you aren&rsquo;t expecting it - ideally, when you aren&rsquo;t even listening to the radio at all. A bright little piece of your life passes you by in a car with the windows rolled down, wells up in the pain-relief aisle of a Rite-Aid. That kind of chance encouter can&rsquo;t happen as readily on an iPod you&rsquo;ve programmed yourslf.</p>

			 <p>I thought it would be interesting to run some numbers on all the Kickstarter projects that I have backed over the years.</p>
<p>I started contributing to crowd funded projects back in October 2014.
I’ve spent around $1300 over 3½ years and 19 Kickstarter projects.</p>
<p>Breaking all the projects down by <em>loose</em> categories, it’s clear I go through waves of interest. Currently I’m in a book and software buying phase and over the stationary phase.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>What’s not on this list is the plethora of projects that I did <strong>not</strong> end up backing and a couple of projects that I ended up buying things directly after the kickstarter project was already over.</p>
<p>Taking the last column and summarising it a little shows me that it’s <em>generally</em> been a positive experience and I’m either using the products or aim to use them in the future:</p>
<table>

<p>Going forward my plan is, with regards to Kickstarter, to be a <strong>lot</strong> more discerning and selective in the projects that I back. Where I see something truly unique and special, that is where I should concentrate my efforts.</p>

<p>After Ryan was born late last year, I have gotten to know Zane and take a much bigger role in shaping the person he is and will be (until school and his friends take over). It strikes me how truly incredible the amount of time, energy, love, tears, worry, joy, sleep (or lack of it) goes into nurturing your child, yet feeling the need to do more as a parent.</p>

I researched a little bit harder and found this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32915485/how-to-prevent-unicode-characters-from-rendering-as-emoji-in-html-from-javascrip">thread</a>. Basically you have to append a unicode variation selector after the html character. This forces the previous character to be rendered as text rather than as an Emoji Symbol.</p>

			 <p>Ryan is absolutely <strong>fascinated</strong> by music.</p>
<p>I stumbled onto this fact by mistake (it feels that parenting is a series of mistakes upwards). When he was only a couple of months old I would sing to calm him down. I chose songs I knew by Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Metallica.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now transitioned to the real thing which has (obviously) increased his verve for beautiful sounds, rather than his dad&rsquo;s poor screetching.</p>

			 <p>You may have noticed <em>discontent</em> amongst some Micro.blog users, in reaction to the latest iOS app addition, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2018/04/wavelength-for-micro-blog.html">Wavelength</a>, to the Micro.blog ecosystem.</p>
<p>The “argument” goes that 3 iOS apps and 1 Mac app later with no love for Windows, Linux or most <em>glaringly</em> Android is a sure sign that the network is doomed (or something else equally as dramatic). Then the knives started coming out, calling the apps suboptimal, which I feel to be insensitive and insulting. Manton’s actually handling this pretty gracefully, which is exactly the attitude I believe is necessary to shepherd the nerds without upsetting them.</p>
<p>I think it’s important for everyone to maintain some perspective. The Kickstarter ended a little over a year ago (back on the 1st of February). The actual service didn’t start opening up to register for a few months after that. This service has only been live for <em>around</em> a year. Lets review what’s happened in that time:</p>

<p><strong>Clearly</strong> the guy is a complete slacker. Clearly.</p>
<p>I can understand people being ‘upset’ about not having an Android app, but my view is this, if there is enough request then it will make <em>business</em> sense to officially support this platform. However, give the man some time to get there!</p>
<p>I would like Manton’s to spend time and complete the book. The reason for this is so that he can close last year’s Kickstarter and look to having another Kickstarter to maybe bring someone else to help him full-time with the development cycles.</p>

			 <p>I feel like I need to quantify that previous statement, because I might not be alone.</p>
<p>Over the last 14 years that I’ve been online I’ve meandered from platform to platform: <em>Blogger, Moveable Type, Wordpress, Habari, Scriptogram, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Medium, Flickr, Instagram, Blot and now Micro.blog</em>.</p>
<p>Listing them all like this it makes me wonder why I’ve had such a haphazard affair with something as simple as writing your thoughts online.</p>
<p>Throughout this journey I have either kept the words that I’ve written (or have clear access to these). The plan is to bring <strong>everything</strong> under one roof. The biggest challenge is deciding what to keep (what is <em>really</em> worth keeping). Will write a bit about my process once it&rsquo;s all done.</p>

			 <p>While going through my Twitter archive, I realised several things which are going to greatly inform the way I write on the web in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li>While linklogging is fun, easy and in many ways the fabric that makes up the internet, it&rsquo;s existence is fleeting. Maybe that link will remain valid for 10 years; or maybe it will last for 6 months. The value is the commentary, opinion or observation and what was important at the time rather than the thing itself. What caught your attention, why should you care, etc.</li>
<li>The mundane rituals of your life now will seem facinating in 10 years time, because likely those same rituals will have changed, or you&rsquo;re with someone else, or in a different country. Take a moment to capture your life as it&rsquo;s playing out now to help trigger some nostalgia further down the road.</li>
<li>Own your stuff. It&rsquo;s important because you ultimately control the format that they&rsquo;re in, now and in the future. <em>I&rsquo;m looking at you Twitter/Tumblr and your shortening links</em>.</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;re 80% happy with the way your site looks like, move back to writing, photographing, drawing, whatever. Leave the final 20% for slow, purposeful and <em>incremental</em> enhancement.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re wondering what type of style you should write, take some advice from one of the guys doing it the best (<a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a>), write as though you&rsquo;re writing to a friend in an email.</li>
<li>Who cares about categories and tags.</li>

			 <p>Last night was the first <em>moment</em> shared by myself and my two boys. And a glorious moment it was.</p>
<p>Since Ryan&rsquo;s been born, the activities shared by the boys has been somewhat limited. One is a 3 1/2 year old, while the other is 3 months old. Ryan though clearly has his father&rsquo;s taste in music. To calm him down I&rsquo;ve taken to singing to him alternative music from the 90s. We&rsquo;ve just finished our <em>Smashing Pumpkins</em> phase and I started singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySzrJ4GRF7s">Fell on black days</a>.</p>
<p>Having not heard the song in 10 years I thought it would be great to blast it out. I mean that&rsquo;s why I have music subscription right? I&rsquo;m holding Ryan and we&rsquo;re <em>dad-shuffling</em> to the music.  A which point Zane decides he wants in on the action as well, so he grabs his massive Ikea shark and starts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing">moshing</a> (I put the link in because I have no idea if this is what it&rsquo;s refered to these days, wait&hellip;they&rsquo;re calling it slamdancing? I&rsquo;ll stick with moshing thank you very much) with it. And it all escalated from there.</p>
<p>Although different in an infinitely number of ways, the whole scene did remind me of that time Stathi and I were 18-19 and went to this club in Athens who either had an alternative night on, or the DJ is hoping to get kicked out. Anyway he was playing <em>our</em> music, which by this stage had fallen out of favour in place of some other pop shit. Towards the end/middle of the night there we were literally the only 2 people on the floor <em>slamdancing</em>.</p>
<p>I think my 18-19 year old self would be super proud of these two.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://www.kramastudio.com">Krama</a> pen I <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2018/02/23/finally-got-my.html">mentioned</a> 10 days ago, arrived today. I&rsquo;ve not had much time to play with it yet, but my initial impressions are that the reasons for me backing the Kickstarter were valid.</p>
<p>The first quality that jumped out at me were the subtle details that show the manufacturers knew what they were doing. Having seen (and backed) enough Kickstarter machined pens, the quality of the <strong>coating</strong> on this pen reaches for the heady heights that a Rotring 600 provides, which is high praise indeed. No other Kickstarter pen has the same quality of coating.</p>
<p>It’s an exceptionally slight pen, no thicker really than a standard 6 sided pencil, so if you like heft to your writing experience, this really isn’t the pen for you. Having recognised the dimensions at play here, I ordered a brass version, which I definitely think is the correct way to go, using a different material would basically have changed the balance of the pen.</p>
<p>This is a simple pen, and that is where it&rsquo;s beauty lies. The mechanism is a bit different to what I&rsquo;ve seen for simple pens (like the <a href="http://baronfig.com">Squire</a> or Retro 51), but it&rsquo;s done very well on this pen and the refill has no wriggle. Part of that I think are the tighter tolerances but also the fact that the back of the pen screws directly into the refill. I did not know that this was an option, but the fact that the pens are machined to consider these tolerances on a standard Schmidt refill is even more impressive.</p>
<p>The pen comes in a unique leather wrap, with a couple of brass rings that hold everything together.  What I like about this approach (and yes I understand that I&rsquo;ve paid for the packaging already) is the fact that there is no plastics involved.</p>
<p>From my brief interaction with the pen, I would certainly recommend this pen to anyone looking for something unique but truly functional.</p>

<p>The downside to this interaction is that my internet lizard brain has certainly kicked in full gear. What happens to me is that I end up going down rabbit holes and tweaking my site over and over again.  I end up wasting an inordinate amount of time.</p>
<p>The saving grace for <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is the fact that I can&rsquo;t tinker with the HTML and once I finally settle on the aesthetics of the site, I can revert to concentrating on more important aspects.</p>

			 <p>One of the fundamental challenges I faced towards the twilight years of my original stint of writing and publishing on the internet (that was nearly 10 years ago now) was the very fact that I didn’t have a singular focus. As my focus meandered, it became a challenge to continue writing meaningful words to capture those ideas with any regularity.</p>
<p>I remember trying very hard to find a focus, even started writing exclusively about Tesla, before I got bored of it all and annoyed people by cluttering up with Facebook feeds with re-posted articles I’d written. By trying to shoehorn myself and the little audience I had, I effectively lost the drive to continue.</p>
<p>This time it’s different. Very different. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>To provide me with a location to collect all my thoughts on the subject of <em>reducing mental overhead</em>.</li>
<li>To provide everyone else with a resource that might help them achieve something important in their life.</li>
<li>I’m now clear that I don’t care to heavily about what the site looks like. Thankfully <a href="http://blot.im">Blot</a> (and David) have me completely covered in one of the best hidden secrets on the internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the last year and a half, I’ve been working in the background on capturing these thoughts and putting them into a coherent document. At the time I thought that the best way to get the ball rolling would have been to buy a domain name that I liked and then start a website — no matter how crude. This was the first version:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It didn’t work. It sat there, unloved, for an entire year, which is just as well. Last year was by all accounts a tough year for me, but this allowed the idea to bounce around in my head. To learn about Stoicism, to regroup and rebalance my thoughts on these ideas that started back in 2016. Sometimes time and space are an essential partner for letting thoughts mature.</p>

			 <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve kicked the micro.blog tires for a few days, I can safely say a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I like the fact that this is a paid service. It means you have to get it and want to be involved in it to keep paying. The internet would be a different place if it didn&rsquo;t make everything free.</li>
<li>Loading the timeline is slow (on the site and certainly on iOS and the Mac). It perfectly usable but it doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed either. Not sure if this is something that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> you have your eye on to improve in the future?</li>
<li>Information isn&rsquo;t located discusing the map for the development of the site (and therefore the core service). I understand that if something is good it will grow organically, but I would hope that there is a vision of where this connection is headed towards?</li>
<li>Love being able to use Markdown in my posts.</li>
<li>Shame no #hashtags. Not sure what the reasons for excluding it from the design were?</li>
<li>Because it&rsquo;s small everyone is talking to everyone else. The experience is only enhanced for the better because of it all.</li>
<li>Love how it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much or little you want to write, everything is welcome, it&rsquo;s just displayed a little differently.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to be able to edit my text from the site itself (as long as I&rsquo;m logged in).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to be able to download all my posts as single .md files, rather than a WordPress (???) export of some description. If not single .md files, then at least 1 single .md file. I&rsquo;m currently using IFTTT to append my words to a text file via the RSS feed. The only problem my glorious Markdown is converted in the HTML.</li>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a super interesting week for my internet life. After pulling away from it all for a significant amount of time, I now believe I&rsquo;ve found the necessary tools to get something out of it. This micro.blog is my therapy of sorts (some of the more deeply personal stuff is bound to stay hidden somewhere in my journal), and <a href="http://rmo.life">RMO</a> is pretty much my ideal setup for writing and editing long form (mainly due to the control the app affords me over the layout).</p>
<p>So for now my internet output is really split across 3 main locations, each with very specific goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://kaa.micro.blog">kaa.micro.blog</a> - Digital Drawer</li>
<li><a href="http://rmo.life">rmo.life</a> - Capturing all things related to RMO</li>
<li><a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kaa">pinboard.in/u:kaa</a> - Links you should remember</li>

			 <p>As I start to rekindle my love for writing and publishing online again (I’m still trying to decide on another word to <em>blogging</em>, a term I dislike the sound of), I’ve decided that I actually don’t want to clutter up my feed with a linklog - even if this link log has some exceptionally witty commentary. I’d like to keep this particular site dedicated to my more <em>thoughtful</em> digital explorations.</p>
<p>What I hadn’t considered was the power of the system that I actually have in place already in my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kaa/public/">Pinboard</a> account. Interesting links already exist there. The only part of this system I’ve not really been using is the description or notes section. You can subscribe to the RSS feed <a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:kaa/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is really annoying to me is that I’ve had this Pinboard account for 6 years and never thought to invest the time in it before now.</p>

			 <p>I finally got my Kickstarter backed ‘Single Edge’ razor handle from <a href="https://getsupply.com">Supply</a> today. This is actually the second time that the package was sent to me, as the first set was lost in the mail. This usually doesn’t happen to me, but thankfully the guys over at <em>Supply</em> were gracious enough to hook me up with a full replacement.</p>
<p>The packaging did completely take me aback. It’s unashamedly aping Apple’s packaging. I know one is offering high tech gear, while there other is a razor handle, but I do wonder if the “homage” was taken a little too far in this instance. From this <a href="https://vimeo.com/167887992">videos</a>, an alternative packaging seems to have been made (possibly for the previous version?), which I actually prefer as it calls back to a time when these <em>injector blades</em> were widely used. I think the ‘heritage’ should be celebrated more.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice about the handle itself is the sleekness of it followed by the sheer weightiness of it - this thing is <strong>heavy</strong>. The other thing that you’ll notice is the lovely little manual on the inside that goes through a bunch of interesting aspects that you should consider. Patrick and Jennifer are effectively trying to re-educate us on a style of shaving that went out of fashion, only to be replaced by electric razors and 5 blade disposable garbage from the supermarket.</p>
<p>Having shaved with it, I can say it does give you a very close shave. I’ve been using double edged safety razors for nearly 5 years now and while those shaves were infinitely better to what I was using before, this makes my skin much smoother. The draw back however is that in order for it to do this, it might irritate the skin - maybe only until my skin gets used to it?</p>
<p>To complete my pledge, I also opted for the <a href="https://getsupply.com/collections/all-products/products/marble-shaving-bowl">marble bowl</a>. It has ridges at the bottom. My shaving cream of choice is <a href="https://www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk">Taylor of Old Bond Street</a>, Sandlewood, which was first introduced to me by my brother in one of our care packages - I’ve been hooked ever since. The combination of the two created an amazingly smooth and thick rich lather.</p>
<p>It’s not every day that one enhances their daily routine of shaving. If you’re going to do it, go all in.</p>

			 <p>It’s been a year already? The latest lineup for the Hobonichi Techo 2016 (in Japanese for now) is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Unlike last year, where I was completely taken by the buzz and the excitement of something new, I now know what to expect and more crucially what I like and need.</p>
<p>The A6 size hasn’t worked out for me as I would have liked. I found myself running out of space on occasions, or ended up looking to complete my thoughts elsewhere. That’s going to have to change if I’m going to use this book as my catchall for everything. I am a huge lover of the A5 size, and while the ‘Cousin’ version of the Hobonichi planner is in fact all in Japanese, it’s functional enough to not be a problem.</p>
<p>The biggest draw for this notebook is the paper, which is without equal. I’ve tried many different papers this year, but the Tomoe River paper has stood out as the undeputed champion when it comes to making the most out of inks and pens that I use.</p>
<p>The Hobonichi Techo will remain my notebook of choice, where I dump all my thoughts and ideas into a single place. The only bad thing is that I now need a new cover - the new ones are a big disappointment, so I’m looking to Etsy for some alternatives. Top of my list are these covers from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StrideRidge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - and they’re actually affordable unlike some of these &lsquo;official’ covers on offer.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I just published the first full colour <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon Racket!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> strip, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taking a Minute<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I’ll be getting into my overall setup at some point, but this is a decided shift from me as I have until now published only in black and white.</p>
<p>This is not a sign that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> no longer believe in black &amp; white, but maybe rather the strip is better served on the internet with a splash of colour - I’ll report on whether that theory holds water after a few of these have gone out, but my feeling is that this small change will make a noticable difference.</p>
<p>As this is still the first one, like with most strips, there will be an evolution of the colour art as I get more comfortable with the process and try different ideas.The only downside, is that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon Racket!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> website will now have to be tweaked slightly to capture this colour palette (which is slightly different from previous iterations of colour that I’ve used in promo art).</p>

<p>I got a bunch of Shinhan Art pens last week. I was so excited to use them that this little image popped out in a matter of minutes. One of the most encouraging things about sticking with a bunch of characters is watching their evolution happen before your eyes. There is a confidence that I’m aware of and actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> enjoying experiencing at the moment. I just wish I could do this more regularly.</p>

			 <p>Ever since I ‘relaunched’ the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon Racket!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’ve not been particularly happy with the footer. I always knew that it would have to change. My initial use of the footer was to effectively send people to different parts of the net that related to all things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon Racket!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account, the facebook account, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newsletter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->process blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. All of these links have now moved to the very top of the website, in a nice menu bar, that’s out of the way, but fully accessible if needed.</p>
<p>I received some negative feedback, when I publishing the first season, that sticks in my mind. It was from a woman that didn’t really understand what was going on in the series. On reflection I totally get that. At the time I couldn’t do anything about it, as the stories and art had been created. I knew I had to do better with the second series.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make the series more accessible, the stories have been written to not be as presumtive, but also the website should be first time reader friendly. To address these two issues, I’ve decided to use the footer as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What You Need to Know<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section, complete with character head shots and names, using those sketches from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previous post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>I needed a colour that would <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> against the grey backgrounds that I was using.

Living away from any family that can help us with the boy has been a challenge at times, but these 22 programmes have acted like a baby sitter of sorts to keep him occupied briefly while we do things like eating our dinner, cleaning up the kitchen or putting a laundry - you know the super exciting things in life.</p>
<p>Zane <!-- raw HTML omitted -->loves<!-- raw HTML omitted --> these characters. Something about them strike a real cord with him. So when his first birthday came about, I knew we had to celebrate with them. I’m planning on getting the art behind these characters made as a print soon to hang up in his room.</p>
<p>What’s amazing to me is just how great the cake came out, it’s a technology I’ve seen used before (as I was reminded by my wife), but I’ve never done anything with it. Here’s to many more happy birthday’s Zane. What a year it’s beeen.</p>

<p>Continuing this series of posts on the evolution of characters from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon Racket!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this is first full sketch of Corgan.</p>
<p>What’s facinating to me is just how much information was captured in this one image that I don’t even remember creating. The main features of the character are there, such as the white boots, the shape of the head and the eyes and most importantly the colour palette that was chosen.</p>
<p>The neck reduced in height significantly in later iterations, but this has always been a general favourite sketch of mine because it helped define the world I am trying to create in many subtle ways.</p>

<p>The image that started <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moon Racket<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The incredible part (when you consider the physical and hardware constraints) is that it was all created on an iPhone 4. I’ve written about this before (probably on my now defunct Facebook page), the intention was to create a super <!-- raw HTML omitted -->simple<!-- raw HTML omitted --> character that could be easily drawn on that tiny little screen.</p>
<p>As time went on, the character evolved. While I now find him incredibly easy to draw (and can tell instantly when I’ve not done a good job of my lines), that wasn’t always the case.</p>
<p>In fact the first year of Corgan’s life, I wasn’t super comfortable with certain aspects of his drawing him (so much so I remember the very first strip, I thought to trace him as I spent long on the first panel, but quickly realised that I was being stupid and foolish).</p>

			 <p>Traditionally I’ve been a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->huge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tinkerer of my websites. Thankfully I turned a leaf last year and decided on a structure and function for each site and only allowed time for enhancing or correcting initial laziness.</p>
<p>For my personal musing site, I recently updated the CSS code to benefit from some of the theme editing functions that Tumblr provides. The whole design of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->KAA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was intentionally completely text based to allow me to have infinite colour combinations.</p>
<p>As a fun experiment, I’ve been taking screenshots of the various colour schemes that I come up with.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that I’ve not actually written anything meaningful on there for 5 months begs the question of why the design is even relevant, I’m just glad it’s there for when I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eventually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pull my finger out.</p>

			 <p>As this is a process site after all, I’ll be posting many more of these collections as I start to publish the new season.</p>
<p>This is one of the first images I ever drew using blue pencil lead instead of standard graphite. It’s also one of the first images that shows all the recent iterations of the characters are located in one image.</p>
<p>This image however was done pretty quickly (over an evening in fact, pencil to ink) and was meant to be a way of flexing my muscles. I didn’t even know what the characters were saying to each other (or why). You can read the final strip <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>My biggest error (and I don’t know how it got through) was Woz’s stamp, where the perspective is all wrong. Sometime you just need a simple idea, which lets your pencil move - what you sacrifice for this freedom of movement is that the end result might not be as polished as you would hope.</p>

			 <p>The #nexus pen finally arrived today. Initial thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>The pen is much larger than I thought it was going to be</li>
<li>The packaging is pretty well put together.</li>
<li>The Bock nib is massive. Unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t indicate what type of nib it is either.</li>
<li>Having a Schmidt converter and Bock nib is great but would have been nicer if they had Nexus specific logos. Slightly diminishes the professional view of the product.</li>
<li>Matt coating is excellent.</li>

<p><em>Twinkles</em>. Sometimes you need to spend some time on a particular character, over and over and over again. You develop a rhythm. It’s not until I finished this image that I feel comfortable enough to draw these characters in any situation.</p>

At the very least I have something to beat for this month. I enjoyed the process enough to continue trying to do a small sketch as often as I can.

There is a subtle difference if you missed it: Cod-a-nauts vs Cod-e-nauts.</p>
<p>Oddly enough they seem to have stopped their operation and our operation never took off. I still love the similicity of this logo and hope to use it in the future.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I used to take my toys apart as I tried to understand what made them work. The internal mechanisms fascinated me.</p>
<p>Todd McLellan takes this to a whole new level, and his forthcoming book ‘<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things Come Apart<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’ is definitely a celebration of people with a fascination for the internal mechanism of designed objects - or kids like me.</p>

The most exciting addition being the ability to publish to Tumblr directly from the app itself.
